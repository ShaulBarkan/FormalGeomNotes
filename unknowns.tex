\todo[inline]{I'd like to spend a couple of days talking about ways the picture in this class can be extended, finally, some actually unanswered questions that naturally arise.  The following two section titles are totally made up and probably won't last.}

\section{Orientations by \texorpdfstring{$E_\infty$}{Eoo} maps}

A more modern take on the story of the $\sigma$--orientation passes through the algebraic geometry of $E_\infty$--ring spectra, which are the homotopically coherent analogues of commutative ring objects that one finds in the $\infty$--category $\CatOf{Spectra}$.  Essentially all of the ring spectra discussed in this book have incarnations as $E_\infty$--rings:
\begin{theorem}
\citeme{this is a mega-theorem}
The classical $K$--theories $KU$ and $KO$, the Eilenberg--Mac Lane spectra $HR$, the Morava $E$--theories $E_\Gamma$, their fixed point spectra, the Thom spectra arising from the $J$--homomorphism (including $MO$, $MSO$, $M\Spin$, $M\String$, $MU$, $MSU$, and $MU[6, \infty)$), the spectra $\TMF$, $\Tmf$, and $\tmf$ are all $E_\infty$--ring spectra.\footnote{Notably, the Morava $K$--theories are \emph{not} $E_\infty$ rings at finite heights.} \qed
\end{theorem}

A great deal of classical commutative algebra can be lifted into this new setting, including a particular functor \[\gl_1\co E_\infty\CatOf{RingSpectra} \to \CatOf{Spectra}.\]  This functor derives its name from two compatible sources: for one, its underlying infinite loopspace is the construction $GL_1$ described in \Cref{LectureThomSpectra}; and secondly, it participates in an adjunction
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}[column sep=4em]
\CatOf{ConnectiveSpectra} \arrow[shift left=0.3\baselineskip, "\Susp^\infty_+ \Omega^\infty"]{r} & E_\infty\CatOf{RingSpectra} \arrow[shift left=0.3\baselineskip, "\gl_1"]{l}
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
analogous to the adjunction between the group of units and the group-ring constructions in classical algebra.  Its relevance to us is its participation in the theory of highly structured Thom spectra.  Let $j\co g \to \gl_1 \S$ be a map of connective spectra, begetting an infinite loopmap $J\co G \to \GL_1 \S$, where we have written $G = \Loops^\infty g$.
\begin{lemma}
\citeme{May? or ABGHR?}
The Thom spectrum of the map $BJ$ is presented by the pushout of $E_\infty$ rings
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
\Susp^\infty_+ \GL_1 \S \arrow["\Loops^\infty \Susp j"]{r} \arrow{d} & \Susp^\infty_+ \Loops^\infty \gl_1 \S / g \arrow{d} \\
\S \arrow{r} & MG. \qed
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
\end{lemma}

\begin{corollary}
\citeme{May, but also ABGHR}
There is a natural equivalence between the space of null-homotopies of the composite \[g \xrightarrow j \gl_1 \S \xrightarrow{\gl_1 \eta_R} \gl_1 R\] and the space of $E_\infty$ ring maps $MG \to R$, where $MG$ is the Thom spectrum of the stable spherical bundle classified by $J$.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
Applying the mapping space functor $E_\infty(-, R)$ to the pushout diagram in the Lemma, we have a pullback diagram of mapping spaces:
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
E_\infty(\Susp^\infty_+ \GL_1 \S, R) & E_\infty(\Susp^\infty_+ \Loops^\infty \gl_1 \S / g, R) \arrow{l} \\
E_\infty(\S, R) \arrow{u} & E_\infty(MG, R) \arrow{l} \arrow{u}.
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
We can reidentify each of the three terms to get
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
\CatOf{Spectra}(\gl_1 \S, \gl_1 R) & \CatOf{Spectra}(\gl_1 \S / g, \gl_1 R) \arrow{l} \\
\{\gl_1 \eta_R\} \arrow{u} & E_\infty(MG, R) \arrow{l} \arrow{u},
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
hence $E_\infty(MG, R)$ appears as the fiber at $\gl_1 \eta_R$ of the restriction map, which coincides with the space of nullhomotopies as claimed.
\end{proof}





rational phenomena, Hirzebruch genera revisited

the example of $\Spin$ orientations of $KO_p$:
\begin{itemize}
  \item It's a torsor for $[b\Spin, KO_p]$, which has a computable form using the logarithm.  (Needs the coconnective discrepancy spectrum Lemma.)
  \item It has a basepoint.
\end{itemize}

the canonical map

Irrationality of $\gl_1 \S$ says that the map $\Susp^{-1} \Q/\Z \otimes \gl_1 R \to \gl_1 R$ induces an equivalence upon applying $[\gl_1 \S, -]$, so the map $\gl_1 \eta_R$ corresponds to a unique map $\gl_1 \S \to \Susp^{-1} \Q/\Z \otimes \gl_1 R$.  Composing this with a map $j\co g \to \gl_1 \S$ gives a diagram
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
g \arrow["j"]{r} \arrow{rd}[description]{\Susp^{-1} m_R} & \gl_1 \S \arrow{rd}[description]{\gl_1 \eta_R} \arrow{rrd}[description]{0} \arrow["\exists!"]{d} \\
& \Susp^{-1} \Q/\Z \otimes \gl_1 R \arrow{r} & \gl_1 R \arrow{r} & \Q \otimes \gl_1 R.
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
The map $m_X$ is called the \textit{Miller invariant} (for $j$ and $R$).  This map and this diagram are very close to the kind of diagram one considers when studying orientation theory, where one wants to extend $\gl_1 \eta_R$ to maps $\alpha$ over the cone $\gl_1 \S / g$ of the map $j$:
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
g \arrow["j"]{r} & \gl_1 \S \arrow["\exists!"]{d} \arrow{r} \arrow{rd}[description]{\gl_1 \eta_R} & \gl_1 \S / g \arrow{r} \arrow{rd} \arrow[densely dotted]{d}[description]{\alpha} & bg \arrow{r} \arrow{rd}[description]{m_R} \arrow[densely dotted]{d}[description]{\beta} & b\gl_1 \S \arrow["\exists!"]{d} \\
& \Susp^{-1} \Q/\Z \otimes \gl_1 R \arrow{r} & \gl_1 R \arrow{r} & \Q \otimes \gl_1 R \arrow{r} & \Q/\Z \otimes \gl_1 R.
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
The vertical maps appears in the Miller invariant show that $\alpha$ and $\beta$ determine each other.  The maps $\beta$ are easier to analyze, since they have a rational target: $[bg, \Q \otimes \gl_1 R]$ is populated by sequences of sequences of elements in the rational homotopy of $\gl_1 R$.  Those sequences which correspond to maps $\beta$ making the diagram commute are exactly those which postcompose with the irrationalization map to give $m_R$, and this is something that can be checked on homotopy.\footnote{Mapping to $\Q \otimes \gl_1 R$ means factoring through $\Q \otimes bg$, and maps of rational spectra are determined on homotopy.  I would like to seal this up by saying that rational spectra can't map into irrational ones in ``invisible'' ways.}



\textbf{Question:} Why is the Miller invariant naturally attached to $\gl_1$?  Couldn't we take $0$--connected covers of a map of ring spectra and deduce identical-sounding statements?  Is it helpful to observe that $\CP^\infty$ rationally \emph{multiplicatively} generates $bSU$, or something like that?




\textbf{Now work $K(1)$--locally.}


The next claim (5.19.vi) is that maps $R \to S$ of ring spectra which are $6$--connective induce equivalences on the respective spaces of $E_\infty$ $\String$--orientations.  (Their argument has two pieces: first, they show that if $A(S)$ is nonempty, then $A(R)$ is nonempty.  Then, since they know that they are both torsors for $[b\String, \gl_1 R] = [b\String, \gl_1 S]$ (wait, what? Isn't that only a statement available on $\pi_0$?), they must be equivalent as nonempty spaces.)

There is the following important logarithm utility calculation:

\begin{theorem}[{\cite[Theorem 4.11]{AHR}}]
Let $R$ be an $E_\infty$ ring spectrum satisfying $R = L_d R$, and set $F$ to be the fiber \[F \to \gl_1 R \to L_n \gl_1 R.\]  Then $\pi_* F$ is torsion and $F$ satisfies the coconnectivity condition $F \simeq F(-\infty, d]$. \qed
\end{theorem}

\noindent from which it follows that $\gl_1 KO_p \to KO_p$ is a $1$--connected map and $\gl_1 \tmf_p \to \tmf_p$ is a $2$--connected map.  So, for the purposes of studying $\String$ orientations, it is safe to follow the logarithm and consider its target as the spectrum under $\gl_1 \S$:
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
\mathit{string} \arrow["j"]{r} & \gl_1 \S \arrow["\exists!"]{d} \arrow{r} \arrow{rd}[description]{\gl_1 \eta_{KO_p}} & \gl_1 \S / \mathit{string} \arrow{r} \arrow{rd} \arrow[densely dotted]{d}[description]{\alpha} & b\String \arrow{r} \arrow{rd}[description]{m_{KO_p}} \arrow[densely dotted]{d}[description]{\beta} & b\gl_1 \S \arrow["\exists!"]{d} \\
& \Susp^{-1} \Q/\Z \otimes \gl_1 KO_p \arrow{r} \arrow{d} & \gl_1 KO_p \arrow{r} \arrow{d}[description]{\ell} & \Q \otimes \gl_1 KO_p \arrow{r} \arrow{d}[description]{\Q \otimes \ell} & \Q/\Z \otimes \gl_1 KO_p \arrow{d} \\
& \Susp^{-1} \Q/\Z \otimes KO_p \arrow{r} & KO_p \arrow{r} & \Q \otimes KO_p \arrow{r} & \Q/\Z \otimes KO_p.
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}

The main effect of this is that $KO_p$ is a $K(1)$--local spectrum, so we earn the right to $K(1)$--localize the sources:
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}[column sep=1em]
\Susp^{-1} KO_p \arrow{r} \arrow[equal]{d} & L_{K(1)} \S \arrow{r} \arrow[equal]{d}[description]{\ell} & KO_p \arrow{r} \arrow[equal]{d}[description]{\ell,\mathrm{Adams}} & KO_p \arrow{r} \arrow[equal]{d} & L_{K(1)} \S^1 \arrow[equal]{d}[description]{\ell} \\
L_{K(1)} \mathit{string} \arrow["j"]{r} & L_{K(1)} \gl_1 \S \arrow["\exists!"]{d} \arrow{r} \arrow{rd}[description]{\gl_1 \eta_R} & L_{K(1)} \gl_1 \S / L_{K(1)} \mathit{string} \arrow{r} \arrow{rd} \arrow[densely dotted]{d}[description]{\alpha} & L_{K(1)} b\String \arrow{r} \arrow{rd}[description]{m_{KO_p}} \arrow[densely dotted]{d}[description]{\beta} & L_{K(1)} b\gl_1 \S \arrow["\exists!"]{d} \\
& \Susp^{-1} \Q/\Z \otimes KO_p \arrow{r} & KO_p \arrow{r} & \Q \otimes KO_p \arrow{r} & \Q/\Z \otimes KO_p.
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}

The upshot of what AHR expect to get out of this is a little different from what we've been talking about so far --- so maybe it's worth understanding.  First, fillers $\alpha$ are supposed to have now been identified as particular points in $[KO_p, KO_p]$.  Ancient calculation identifies \emph{all} such maps as sequences of $p$--adic rationals satisfying an interesting integrability condition: \[[KO_p, KO_p] \to \prod_{j=-\infty}^\infty \pi_{2j} KO_p \to \prod_{j=-\infty}^\infty \Q_p\] is already inclusion of the set of sequences satisfying the generalized K\"ummer congruences.  First, we need to account for the effect the logarithm had on changing the source and target: this means we are no longer looking for sequences satisfying the K\"ummer congruences, but sequences which satisfy rescaled K\"ummer congruences.  Then, we are looking for maps which make the square with the Miller invariant commute, and it is easiest to encode this condition by rotating it through: the rationalized data above agrees with the image of these homotopy generators under the rationalization map, which is supposed to also agree with the extension $\beta$ over $L_{K(1)} b\String$.  Checking that $\beta$ refines the Miller invariant is a matter of calculating the Miller invariant (which I don't know how to do, but which Haynes's paper portends to tell me), resulting in a condition on the denominators of the $p$--adic sequence.

\begin{theorem}
\citeme{AHR Proposition 7.10}
The set of fillers $\alpha$ can be identified with the set of sequences $(b_k) \in \prod_{j=-\infty}^\infty \Q_p$ satisfying the two conditions
\begin{enumerate}
\item $(1 - c^k)(1 - p^{k-1}) b_k$ satisfies the generalized K\"ummer congruences.
\item $b_k = B_k / (2k)$ as elements of $\Q_p / \Z_p$, where $B_k$ is the $k${\th} Bernoulli number.
\qed
\end{enumerate} 
\end{theorem}

5.3: $A(\gl_1 R) = \CatOf{Alg}_{E_\infty}(M\String, R)$.

7.3: $\pi_0 A, B, C$ on $KO_p$ and $\gl_1 KO_p$ are all equal.

Jeremy: $A(L_{K(1)} \gl_1 KO_p) = \CatOf{Spectra}(KO_p, KO_p)$

$\pi_0 \CatOf{Spectra}(KO_p, KO_p)$ injects into $\pi_{*>0} KO_p \otimes \Q$. ($p$-adic measures and $K$-theory $\Rightarrow$) the image is even sequences satisfying the generalized Kummer congruences.

Jeremy's nonlocal diagram puts this in bijection with a subset of maps $b\String \to \Q \otimes \gl_1 KO_p$.

LINGERING QUESTION: what is the subset in the previous step?

Putative 7.10: $u \in B(L_{K(1)} \gl_1 KO_p)$ biject with $(b_k) \in D(KO_p) = \prod_{k \ge 4} \Q_p$ satisfying generalized Kummer congruences and $b_k = -B_k/2k \pmod{\Z_p}$.







\subsection{Mike's perspective}

\subsubsection{The torsor acting on $E_\infty$ orientations}
$\Spin$-orientations of $KO_p$ agree with nullhomotopies of the composite \[\Susp^{-1} b\Spin \to \gl_1 \S \to \gl_1 KO_p,\] which agree with extensions over the cofiber sequence \[\Susp^{-1} b\Spin \to \gl_1 \S \to C \to b\Spin\] of a map $C \to \gl_1 KO_p$.  Notice also that there is a sequence \[\gl_1 \S \to \gl_1 KO_p \xrightarrow{\psi_\ell(x) / x} \gl_1 KO_p,\] which is \emph{not} a cofiber sequence but $\gl_1 KO_p$ at least receives a map from the cofiber of map between the first two terms.  Somehow this means that the collection of extensions $C \to \gl_1 KO_p$, if it is nonempty, is a torsor for the group $[b\Spin, \gl_1 KO_p]$.

This group can be canonically identified: these maps are rationally determined, we can use the logarithm to map $\gl_1 KO_p$ down to $KO_p$ (where we have an understood basis of the homotopy elements), and $b\Spin$ maps to (or do we want from?) $bU$ which also has a preferred homotopy basis (related to Hirzebruch genera). The effect of $\psi^\ell(x) / x$ and of the logarithm account for condition (i) in AHR 7.10.

\subsubsection{The canonical map}
The availability of a map $C \to \gl_1 KO$ is supposed to induce a map $\gl_1 \S \to \Susp^{-1} \gl_1 KO_{\Q/\Z}$ which precomposes to give a map $\Susp^{-1} b\String \to \Susp^{-1} \gl_1 KO_{\Q/\Z}$ which is independent of the actual map off of $C$ picked.  Calculating what this map is (which amounts to compute its behavior on homotopy, it seems) yields the Bernoulli numbers. This same phenomenon in the $\tmf$ case selects the Eisenstein series.

This is also supposed to help select a basepoint for the torsor, and the correct incantation will yield the ABS orientation.  Mike also said this as selecting something like an ``integrality condition'': there's the space of all sequences in $\Q_p^{\times \infty}$, certain unit sequences acting by multiplication, and then some ``integral'' sequences that are actually realizable.

Mike says there are several ways to calculate this canonical map / integrality condition.  He pointed to Haynes's \textit{Universal Bernoulli numbers}, which is I think explained in AHR.  He also said there was some trick using the $S^1$-transfer

    \[S^1 \sm \CP^\infty \to \S^0\]

which has a canonical lift through $\Susp^{-1} \S_{\Q/\Z}$, and then he trailed off.  Something about mapping along the unit $\S \to KO_p$.

LINGERING QUESTION: AHR cites in Example 5.15-6 the Hirzebruch series of the ABS orientation as where the universal Bernoulli numbers come from. (Note also that they assert the independence of these numbers from the orientation right around there too.) How do they do this computation in the $\tmf$ case, where they don't have access to a preexisting orientation?




Jeremy told me to think about the $S^1$--transfer business this way: start by thinking of $\CP^\infty_+$ as the homotopy orbits of a point with trivial $S^1$--action, so that $\S^0$ is the homotopy orbits of $ES^1$.  The transfer is an equivariant stable map $pt \to ES^1_+$ which is dual to the restriction map $ES^1_+ \to pt$.  Calculating the cofiber of the transfer is equivalent to calculating the fiber of the restriction, dualizing, and taking homotopy orbits.  Since we're stable, calculating the fiber of the restriction is equivalent to calculating the cofiber, which is geometrically-visibly a representation sphere.  The homotopy orbits of that are the colimit over $BS^1$ of a certain spherical bundle, i.e., a certain Thom spectrum.





\begin{theorem}[Unpublished work of Hopkins and Lurie]
Let $F_d$ denote the discrepancy spectrum for $E_d$.  There is a natural equivalence of infinite loopspaces $\Loops^\infty F_d \simeq \Susp^d \mathbb I_{\Q/\Z}$. \qed
\end{theorem}





\subsection{Other things to mention back here}




The $\tmf$ outline is to work by chromatic fracture, comparing $\tmf = L_2 \tmf$ to its $K$--localizations.  There are no maps from $b\String = kO[8, \infty)$ into $L_{K(2)} \tmf$, since $L_{K(2)} kO[8, \infty) = L_{K(2)} kO = 0$.  So, all of the work is in the $K(1)$--local case, either into $L_{K(1)} \tmf$ or $L_{K(1)} L_{K(2)} \tmf$.  One of these is supposed to look like the $p$--adic $K$--theory case (though I'm not sure exactly how) (cf.\ the introduction to the lesser known Ando--Hopkins--Rezk, where they talk about mapping into a $K$--algebra).  The other is supposed to get involved through power operations and the logarithm.  The algebraic picture is supposed to be Katz's monodromy of the $p$--adic moduli of elliptic curves, though it is also not clear to me how.



The ``moments of measures'' picture is pretty nice inside of stable homotopy theory, and it has a nice pedigree (as outlined in the lesser-known AHR).  There they also say that the same picture is crucial in the classical analysis of $p$--adic modular forms, which is worth understanding and describing too.



Haynes's \textit{Universal Bernoulli Numbers} paper is about describing the effect of the $S^1$--transfer in the $MU$--Adams spectral sequence.  The notion is that any convergent spectral sequence can be used to calculate it, and inside of a complex-orientable setting (as for a connected integral complex-orientable spectrum), one can get control over the basics of the Adams spectral sequence by understanding the coaction of $MU_* MU$ on $MU_* \CP{}_{-\infty}^{\infty}$, which is the cofiber of some other (related) transfer.  Unsurprisingly, given all the references, he ends up playing a similar trick to what appears in AHR: he rationalizes $MU$ and studies the difference series $x / \exp_{MU}(x)$ (which specializes in the case of $MU \to KU$ to $x / (1 - e^{-x})$, which is supposed to be where the original Bernoulli numbers appear in the ABS orientation arise).







\Cref{OrdinaryHomologyInUpperHalfPlaneEx} is an inspiration for considering $\tmf$ as well.

\section{Rational phenomena: character theory for Lubin--Tate spectra}

There's a sufficient amount of reliance on character theory in Matt's thesis that we should talk about it.  You should write that action and then backtrack here to see what you need for it.

See Morava's \textit{Local fields} paper

\begin{theorem}\citeme{Theorem A}
Let $E$ be any complex-oriented cohomology theory.  Take $G$ to be a finite group and let $\CatOf{Ab}_G$ be the full subcategory of the orbit category of $G$ built out of abelian subgroups of $G$.  Finally, let $X$ be a finite $G$--CW complex.  Then, each of the natural maps \[E^*(EG \times_G X) \to \lim_{A \in \CatOf{Ab}_G} E^*(EG \times_A X) \to \int_{A \in \CatOf{Ab}_G} E^*(BA \times X^A)\] becomes an isomorphism after inverting the order of $G$.  In particular, there is an isomorphism \[\frac{1}{|G|} E^* BG \to \lim_{A \in \CatOf{Ab}_G} \frac{1}{|G|} E^* BA. \qed\]
\end{theorem}

This is an analogue of Artin's theorem:
\begin{theorem}
There is an isomorphism \[\frac{1}{|G|} R(G) \to \lim_{C \in \CatOf{Cyclic}_G} \frac{1}{|G|} R(C). \qed\]
\end{theorem}

HKR intro material connecting Theorem A to character theory:

Recall that classical characters for finite groups are defined in the following situation: take $L = \Q^{\mathrm{ab}}$ to be the smallest characteristic $0$ field containing all roots of unity, and for a finite group $G$ let $Cl(G; L)$ be the ring of class functions on $G$ with values in $L$.  The units in the profinite integers $\widehat{\Z}$ act on $L$ as the Galois group over $\Q$, and since $G = \CatOf{Groups}(\widehat{\Z}, G)$ they also act naturally on $G$.  Together, this gives a conjugation action on $Cl(G; L)$: for $\phi \in \widehat{\Z}$, $g \in G$, and $\chi \in Cl(G; L)$, one sets \[(\phi \cdot \chi)(g) = \phi(\chi(\phi^{-1}(g))).\]  The character map is a ring homomorphism \[\chi: R(G) \to Cl(G; L)^{\widehat{\Z}},\] and this induces isomorphisms \[\chi: L \otimes R(G) \xrightarrow{\simeq} Cl(G; L)\] and even \[\chi: \Q \otimes R(G) \xrightarrow{\simeq} Cl(G; L)^{\widehat{\Z}}.\]

Now take $E = E_\Gamma$ to be a Morava $E$--theory of finite height $d = \height(\Gamma)$.  Take $E^*(B\Z_p^d)$ to be topologized by $B(\Z/p^j)^d$.  A character $\alpha: \Z_p^d \to S^1$ will induce a map $\alpha^*: E^* \CP^\infty \to E^* B\Z_p^d$.  We define $L(E^*) = S^{-1} E^*(B\Z_p^d)$, where $S$ is the set of images of a coordinate on $\CP^\infty_E$ under $\alpha^*$ for nonzero characters $\alpha$.  Note that this ring inherits an $\operatorname{Aut}(\Z_p^d)$ action by $E^*$--algebra maps.

The analogue of $Cl(G; L)$ will be $Cl_{d,p}(G; L(E^*))$, defined to be the ring of functions $\chi: G_{d, p} \to L(E^*)$ stable under $G$--orbits.  Noting that \[G_{d,p} = \operatorname{Hom}(\Z_p^d, G),\] one sees that $\operatorname{Aut}(\Z_p^d)$ acts on $G_{d,p}$ and thus on $Cl_{d,p}(G; L(E^*))$ as a ring of $E^*$--algebra maps: given $\phi \in \operatorname{Aut}(\Z_p^d)$, $\alpha \in G_{d,p}$, and $\chi \in Cl_{d,p}(G; L(E^*))$ one lets \[(\phi \cdot \chi)(\alpha) = \phi(\chi(\phi^{-1}(\alpha))).\]

Now we introduce a finite $G$--CW complex $X$.  Let \[\operatorname{Fix}_{d, p}(G, X) = \coprod_{\alpha \in \operatorname{Hom}(\Z_p^d, G)} X^{\operatorname{im} \alpha}.\]  This space has commuting actions of $G$ and $\operatorname{Aut}(\Z_p^d)$.  We set \[Cl_{d, p}(G, X; L(E^*)) = L(E^*) \otimes_{E^*} E^*(\operatorname{Fix}_{d,p}(G, X))^G,\] which is again an $E^*$--algebra acted on by $\operatorname{Aut}(Z_p^d)$.  We define the character map ``componentwise'': a homomorphism $\alpha \in \operatorname{Hom}(\Z_p^d, G)$ induces \[E^*(EG \times_G X) \to E^*(B\Z_p^d) \otimes_{E^*} E^*(X^{\operatorname{im} \alpha}) \to L(E^*) \otimes_{E^*} E^*(X^{\operatorname{im} \alpha}).\]  Taking the direct sum over $\alpha$, this assembles into a map \[\chi_{d,p}^G: E^*(EG \times_G X) \to Cl_{d,p}(G, X; L(E^*))^{\operatorname{Aut}(Z_p^d)}.\]
\todo{Nat taught you how to say all these things with $p$--adic tori, which was \emph{much} clearer.}
\begin{theorem}\citeme{Theorem C}
The invariant ring is $L(E^*)^{\operatorname{Aut}(\Z_p^d)} = p^{-1} E^*$, and $L(E^*)$ is faithfully flat over $p^{-1} E^*$.\todo{Checking this invariant ring claim is easiest done by comparing the functors the two things corepresent.}  The character map $\chi_{d,p}^G$ induces isomorphisms
\begin{align*}
\chi_{d,p}^G \co L(E^*) \otimes_{E^*} E^*(EG \times_G X) & \xrightarrow{\simeq} Cl_{d,p}(G, X; L(E^*)), \\
\chi_{d,p}^G \co p^{-1} E^*(EG \times_G X) & \xrightarrow{\simeq} Cl_{d,p}(G, X; L(E^*))^{\operatorname{Aut}(\Z_p^d)}.
\end{align*}
In particular, when $X = *$, there are isomorphisms
\begin{align*}
\chi_{d,p}^G \co L(E^*) \otimes_{E^*} E^*(BG) & \xrightarrow{\simeq} Cl_{d,p}(G; L(E^*)), \\
\chi_{d,p}^G \co p^{-1} E^*(BG) & \xrightarrow{\simeq} Cl_{d,p}(G; L(E^*))^{\operatorname{Aut}(\Z_p^d)}. \qed
\end{align*}
\end{theorem}

Jack gives an interpretation of this in terms of formal $\sheaf{O}_L$--modules.

I also have this summary of Nat's of the classical case:

It's not easy to decipher if you weren't there for the conversation, but here's my take on it. First, the map we wrote down today was the non-equivariant chern character: it mapped non-equivariant $KU \otimes \Q$ to non-equivariant $H\Q$, periodified. The first line on Nat's board points out that if you use this map on Borel-equivariant cohomology, you get nothing interesting: $K^0(BG)$ is interesting, but $H\Q^*(BG) = H\Q^*(*)$ collapses for finite $G$. So, you have to do something more impressive than just directly marry these two constructions to get something interesting.

That bottom row is Nat's suggestion of what ``more interesting'' could mean. (Not really his, of course, but I don't know who did this first. Chern, I suppose.) For an integer $n$, there's an evaluation map of (forgive me) topological stacks \[* \mmod (\Z/n) \times \operatorname{Hom}(* \mmod (\Z/n), * \mmod G) \xrightarrow{\mathrm{ev}} * \mmod G\] which upon applying a global-equivariant theory like $K_G$ gives \[K_{\Z/n}(*) \otimes K_G(\coprod_{\text{conjugacy classes of $g$ in $G$}} *) \xleftarrow{ev^*} K_G(*).\]

Now, apply the genuine $G$-equivariant Chern character to the $K_G$ factor to get \[K_{\Z/n}(*) \otimes H\Q_G(\coprod *) \from K_{\Z/n}(*) \otimes K_G(\coprod *),\] where the coproduct is again taken over conjugacy classes in G. Now, compute $K_{\Z/n}(*) = R(\Z/n) = \Z[x] / (x^n - 1)$, and insert this calculation to get \[K_{\Z/n}(*) \otimes H\Q_G(\coprod *) = \Q(\zeta_n) \otimes (\bigoplus_{\text{conjugacy classes}} \Q),\] where $\zeta_n$ is an $n${\th} root of unity.  As $n$ grows large, this selects sort of the part of the complex numbers $\C$ that the character theory of finite groups cares about, and so following all the composites we've built a map \[K_G(*) \to \C \otimes (\bigoplus_{\text{conjugacy classes}} \C).\]  The claim, finally, is that this map sends a $G$-representation (thought of as a point in $K_G(*)$) to its class function decomposition.

\section{The period map}\label{ThePeriodMapSection}

\todo{pp.\ 42-43 of FPFP has some easy-to-state results about this collected.}
\todo{Kohlhaase~\cite{Kohlhaase} references Yu~\cite{Yu} for having closed formulas generalizing the Hopkins--Gross example section.}

Describe Dieudonn\'e crystals and the Tapis de Cartier.

Show how Dieudonn\'e crystals are used to give formulas for the action of the stabilizer group~\cite{DevinatzHopkins}.

Give a sketch explanation of the Gross--Hopkins period map~\cite{Weinstein}.

Draw the picture of the period map at $n = 2$, $p = 2$.  The main reference for this, except for the literal picture, is~\cite[Appendix 25]{HopkinsGrossEquivVBs}.
\begin{itemize}
\item The center of the $\Z_{p^2}$--points of Lubin--Tate space corresponds to the canonical lift, which is the formal group that further acquires an $\mathcal O_A$--module structure.  It has $\pi$--series $[\pi](x) = \pi x + x^{q^2}$.
\item There are three nontrivial points in $\G[2]$: $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\alpha + \beta$.  Quotienting by them gives three points at order $1/(q+1)$, the first bunch of ``quasicanonical lifts'', which have partial formal $\mathcal O_A$--module structures.
\item At each quasicanonical point, you also also form three quotients: two of them make the situation ``worse'', and one of them makes the situation ``better''.  This has to do with the identification $\G / \G[2] \cong \G$.
\item Computing these orders has to do with the Newton polygon associated to the $\pi$--series.
\item The canonical Frobenius $F_{can} = \left[ \begin{array}{cc} 0 & p \\ 1 & 0 \end{array} \right]$ first flips the two coordinates (and scales one by $p$), then flips them back (and scales the other by $p$), and after two flips scaling everything by $p$ scales back down by homogeneous coordinates.
\item Out to order $1/q$, $\pi_{GH}$ is injective.
\item The group $\F_4^\times$ should act by rotation on $\mathbb P^1$.
\item The map $\pi_{GH}$ sends the canonical lift to $0 = [1:0]$, sends the first order quasicanonical points to $\infty = [0:1]$, and alternates from there.  The three branches of ``directions to quotient'' carve $\mathbb P^1$ up into three lobes.  This is because $\pi_{GH}$ is equivariant for \emph{isogenies}, and quotienting by one of these order $2$ subgroups is a lift of the Frobenius isogeny on the residue formal group.
\item These quasicanonical points are the ones with nontrivial stabilizers under the action by the Morava stabilizer group --- all the other points belong to free orbits.  (The canonical lift has the largest stabilizer of all.)
\end{itemize}

Contexts for structured ring spectra

Difficulty in computing $\S_d \actson E_d^*$. (Gross--Hopkins and the period map.)

Barry's $p$--adic measures

Fixed point spectra and e.g. $L_{K(2)} \tmf$.

Blueshift, A--M--S, and the relationship to A--F--G?

Does $E_n$ receive an $E_\infty$ orientation?  Does $BP$?

Remark 12.13 of published $H_\infty$ AHS says their obstruction framework agrees with the $E_\infty$ obstruction framework (if you take everything in sight to have $E_\infty$ structures).  This is almost certainly related to the discussion at the end of Matt's thesis about the $MU$--orientation of $E_d$.\todo{Section 12.4 compares doing $H_\infty$ descent with doing $E_\infty$ descent and shows that they're the same (in the case of interest?).}

Hovey's paper on $v_n$--periodic elements in ring spectra.  He has a nice (and thorough!) exposition on why one should be interested in bordism spectra and their splittings: for instance, a careful analysis of $M\Spin$ will inexorably lead one toward studying $KO$.  It would be nice if studying $M\String$ (and potentially higher analogues) would lead one toward non-completed, non-connective versions of $EO_n$.  Talk about $BoP$, for instance.

Matt's short resolutions of chromatically localized $MU$.






\begin{remark}
It is completely unclear why $MU$ plays such an important mediating role between geometry (i.e., the stable category) and algebra (i.e., sheaves on the moduli of formal groups).  Given a general ring spectrum $R$ and thick prime $\otimes$--ideals $\CatOf C_\alpha$ of perfect $R$--modules, one ask the analogous two questions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Is it possible to find an $R$--algebra $S$ whose context functor induces a homeomorphism of Balmer spectra $\Spec(\CatOf{Modules}_R^{\perf}) \to \Spec(\CatOf{QCoh}(\context{S/R}))$?
\item Are there complementary localizers $L_\alpha\co \CatOf{Modules}_R \to \CatOf{Modules}_{R,(\alpha)}$?  Can they be presented via Bousfield's framework as homological localizations for auxiliary $S$--algebra spectra $S_\alpha$?  Do the contexts $\context{S_\alpha}$ admit compatible localizers with $\context{S}$?
\end{enumerate}
For $R = \S$, this is the role that the $R$--algebra $S = MU$ and the $S$--algebras $S_d = E(d)$ play.  Finding these spectra feels like striking gold, and it is unclear how to produce analogous spectra in general.
\todo{Mathews's work on Galois descent shows that the fixed point map $\CatOf{Modules}_{E_\Gamma, \Aut \Gamma}^{\mathrm{complete}} \to \CatOf{Spectra}_{\Gamma}$ is an equivalence of categories.}
\end{remark}




\begin{remark}
The homotopy of $\widehat L_2 \S$ is also known, by work of Shimomura and collaborators~\cite{Shimomura,ShimomuraYabeM20,ShimomuraYabeL2S} (but see also the reorganization by Behrens~\cite{BehrensRevisited}).  It is \emph{exceedingly} complicated, and it is an open problem to find an expression of it which admits human digestion.  Behrens has pursued a program encoding this problem in terms of modular forms~\cite{BehrensCongruences,BehrensModularDescription,BehrensBuildings}, and Hopkins has proposed a program involving $L$--functions~\cite{StricklandpAdicInterpolation}, motivated by which Hovey and Strickland have shown a kind of continuity result for among the groups~\cite[Section 14]{HoveyStrickland}.
\end{remark}





\begin{remark}
There are also ``finitary'' flavors of chromatic localization available, which are typically less robust but more computable.  They assemble into a diagram:
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
E \arrow{r} \arrow{d} & L_d^{\fin} E \arrow{r} \arrow{d} & L_d E \arrow{d} \\
L_{X(d)} E \arrow{r} & \widehat L_d^{\fin} E \arrow{r} & \widehat L_d E,
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
where $X(d)$ is a finite complex of type exactly $d$, $v$ is a $v_d$--self-map of $X(d)$, $T(d) = X(d)[v^{-1}]$ is the localizing telescope, $\widehat L_d^{\fin}$ is Bousfield localization with respect to $T(d)$ (which can be shown to be independent of choice of $X(d)$ and of $v$), and $L_d^{\fin}$ denotes localization with respect to the class of \emph{finite} $E(d)$--acyclics.  Many things about these functors are known: for instance, $L_{X(d)} L_d = \widehat L_d$, there is a chromatic fracture square relating $L_d^{\fin}$ to $\widehat L_{\le d}^{\fin}$, and $L_d^{\fin} E \simeq L_d E$ if and only if $\widehat L_{\le d}^{\fin} E \simeq \widehat L_{\le d} E$.  One major question about these functors remains open, corresponding the last unsettled nilpotence and periodicity conjecture of Ravenel~\cite[Conjecture 10.5]{RavenelLocalizationWRTPeriodic}: is the map $\widehat L_d^{\fin} E \to \widehat L_d E$ an equivalence?  Multiple proofs and disproofs have been offered, but the literature remains unsettled.
\citeme{Find some proofs and disproofs.}
\end{remark}







\begin{remark}
Writing $M_d$ for the fiber in the sequence $M_d \to L_d \to L_{d-1}$, the filtration spectral sequence associated to the tower in \Cref{ChromaticConvergence} is called the \textit{geometric chromatic spectral sequence}, which has the form $\pi_* M_* \S \Rightarrow \pi_* \S_{(p)}$.  The two forms of filtration data $M_d X$ and $\widehat L_d X$ are actually functorially equivalent to one another:
\begin{align*}
\widehat L_d M_d & \simeq \widehat L_d, &
M_d \widehat L_d & \simeq M_d,
\end{align*}
but they have fairly distinct properties.  For instance, $M_d$ is smashing whereas $\widehat L_d$ is not, $M_d$ is not part of an adjoint pair whereas $\widehat L_d$ is, and the analogue of \Cref{FormulaForKnLocalization} for $M_d$ is ``backwards'':\citeme{I forget who this is due to} \[M_d X \simeq \colim_I \left( M^0(v^I) \sm L_d X \right).\]  The spectrum $M_d X$ also relates to the chromatic fracture square for $X$:
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
M_d X \arrow{d} \arrow[equal]{r} & M_d X \arrow{d} \\
L_d X \arrow{r} \arrow{d} \arrow[dr, phantom, "\lrcorner", very near start] & \widehat L_d X \arrow{d} \\
L_{d-1} X \arrow{r} & L_{d-1} \widehat L_d X.
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
From this, we see that there is a fiber sequence $M_d X \to \widehat L_d X \to L_{d-1} \widehat L_d X$.

The case $d = 1$ gives the prototypical example of the difference between these two presentations of the ``exact height $d$ data'', where the sequence becomes: \[\colim_j (M^0(p^j) \sm L_1 X) \to \lim_j (M_0(p^j) \sm L_1 X) \to \left( \lim_j (M_0(p^j) \sm L_1 X) \right)_{\Q}.\]  If, for instance, $\pi_0 L_1 X = \Z_{(p)}$, then the long exact sequence of homotopy groups associated to this fiber sequence gives
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
\pi_0 \widehat L_1 X \arrow{r} \arrow[equal]{d} & \pi_0 L_0 \widehat L_1 X \arrow{r} \arrow[equal]{d} & \pi_{-1} M_1 X \arrow[equal]{d} \\
\Z^\wedge_p \arrow{r} & \Q_p \arrow{r} & \Z/p^\infty.
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
Coupling this to \Cref{piLK1SExample}, we compute
\begin{align*}
\pi_t M_1 \S^0 & = \begin{cases} \Z/p^\infty & \text{when $t = -1$}, \\ \Z_p / (pk) & \text{when $t = k|v_1| - 1$ and $t = \ne 0$}, \\ \Z/p^\infty & \text{when $t = (0 \cdot |v_1| - 1) - 1 = -2$}, \\ 0 & \text{otherwise}. \end{cases}
\end{align*}
This is a model for what happens generally when passing from $\pi_* \widehat L_d X$ to $\pi_* M_d X$: the $v_j$--torsion--free groups get converted to infinitely $v_j$--divisible groups, with some dimension shifts.\footnote{A height $2$ example of this same phenomenon is visible in Behrens's paper~\cite[Section 7]{BehrensRevisited}.}
\end{remark}



Sections 5.3-4 of Hopkins's ICM address \textit{Algebraic Topology and Modular Forms} has a discussion of what $\eta$ and $\nu$ have to do with $\tmf$, as well as the construction of some interesting ``topological $\theta$--series'' in the elliptic cohomology of certain Thom complexes.
