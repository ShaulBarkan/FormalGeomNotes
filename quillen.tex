\todo{Write an introduction for me.}


\section{Formal varieties}\label{FormalVarietiesLecture}

\todo[inline]{I think this lecture may be too long.  On the other hand, the rational stuff at the end will go rather quickly --- which I know from experience in the Pittsburgh talks.}

Having totally dissected unoriented bordism, we can now turn our attention to other sorts of bordism theories, and there are many available: oriented, $\Spin$, $\String$, complex, \ldots.  We would like to replicate the results from \Cref{UnorientedBordismChapter} for these other contexts, but we quickly see that only one of the listed bordism theories supports this program.  The space $\RP^\infty = BO(1)$ was a key player in the unoriented bordism story, and the only other bordism theory with a similar ground object is complex bordism, with $\CP^\infty = BU(1)$.  So, we will focus on it.

The contents of \Cref{LectureThomSpectra} can be replicated essentially \textit{mutatis mutandis}, resulting in the following theorems:
\begin{theorem}\citeme{Give a reference from Lecture 1.1}
There is a complex $J$--homomorphism \[J_{\C}: BU \to B \GL_1 \S. \qed \]
\end{theorem}

\begin{definition}\citeme{Give a reference from Lecture 1.1}
The associated Thom spectrum is written ``$MU$'' and called \textit{complex bordism}.  A map $MU \to E$ of ring spectra is said to be a \textit{complex orientation of $E$}.\todo{Something I've seen more than once is an equivalence $MU(k) \simeq BU(k) / BU(k-1)$. It's not immediately obvious to me where this comes from. Where does it come from? Is it helpful to think about?}
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}\label{ThomIsomOverC}\citeme{Give a reference from Lecture 1.1}
For a complex vector bundle $\xi$ on a space $X$ and a complex-oriented ring spectrum $E$, there is a natural equivalence \[E \sm T(\xi) \simeq E \sm \Susp^\infty_+ X. \qed\]
\end{theorem}

\begin{corollary}\label{CPinftyNiceCalculation}\citeme{Give a reference from Lecture 1.1}
In particular, for a complex-oriented ring spectrum $E$ it follows that $E^* \CP^\infty$ is isomorphic to a one--dimensional power series ring. \qed
\end{corollary}

In light of these results, it seems prudent to develop some of the theory of formal schemes and formal varieties outside of the context of $\F_2$--algebras.

\begin{definition}
Fix a scheme $S$.  A formal $S$--scheme $X = \{X_\alpha\}_\alpha$ is an ind-system of Artinian $S$--schemes $X_\alpha$.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
In the case $S = \Spec k$ for a field $k$, ``Artinian'' means that $\sheaf{O}_{X_\alpha}$ is a finite--dimensional $k$--vector space.
\end{remark}

These ind-systems arise when studying completions of rings.  To address the geometric situation, we first owe ourselves a definition of a closed subscheme:
\begin{definition}\label{DefnCompletion}
Let $X$ be an affine formal scheme, and pick a chart $\Spec R \to X$.  A subscheme $Y \subseteq X$ is called \textit{closed} when it has the form
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
Y \arrow{r} \arrow[-,double,densely dotted]{d} & X \arrow[-,double]{d} \\
\Spec (R/I) \arrow{r} & \Spec R.
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
\end{definition}

There's a complementary notion of an open subscheme, which we will continue to avoid for now.  These definitions are both best stated in a coordinate--free way, but the open subscheme version really \emph{requires} it, so we will postpone it until later.\oweproof{Definition of open scheme}\oweproof{Definition of closed subscheme without chart}  For now, we will proceed with the geometry:

\begin{definition}
Consider such a closed subscheme $Y$ of an affine $S$--scheme $X$, modeled by a map $\Spec R/I \to \Spec R$.  We define the \textit{$n${\th} order neighborhood of $Y$ in $X$} to be the scheme $\Spec R/I^{n+1}$.  The \textit{formal neighborhood of $Y$ in $X$} is then the ind-system \[X^\wedge_Y := \left\{ \Spec R/I \to \Spec R/I^2 \to \Spec R/I^3 \to \cdots \right\}.\]
\end{definition}

\noindent So, formal schemes arise naturally when studying the local geometry of $X$ near a subscheme $Y$.  An exceedingly common situation is for $X$ to be a variety and $Y$ to be a smooth point, so that $X^\wedge_Y$ looks like ``a small piece of affine space''.  We pin this important case down with a definition:

\begin{definition}
In the case that $S = \Spec R$ is affine, formal affine $n$--space over $S$ is defined by \[\A^n = \Spf R\llbracket x_1, \ldots, x_n\rrbracket.\]  A \textit{formal affine variety} is a formal scheme $V$ which is (noncanonically) isomorphic to $\A^n$ for some $n$.  The two maps in an isomorphism pair \[V \to \A^n, \quad V \leftarrow \A^n\] are called a \textit{coordinate (system)} and a \textit{parameter (system)} respectively.
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}\label{MapsOfFVarsArePowerSeries}
A pointed map $\A^n \to \A^m$ is identical to an $m$--tuple of $n$--variate power series with no constant term. \qed
\end{lemma}

\begin{remark}
In some sense, \Cref{MapsOfFVarsArePowerSeries} is a full explanation for why anyone would even think to involve formal geometry in algebraic topology (nevermind how useful the program has been in the long run).  Calculations in algebraic topology are frequently expressed in terms of power series rings, and with this Lemma we are proved geometric interpretations for such statements.
\end{remark}

\Cref{MapsOfFVarsArePowerSeries} shows how formal varieties are especially nice, because maps between them can be boiled down to statements about power series.  In particular, this allows theorems from analytic differential geometry to be imported, including a version of the inverse function theorem, which we will now work towards.

\begin{definition}
Let $V$ be a formal variety and let $I_V = \A^1(V)$ be the ideal of functions vanishing at the origin.  Then, we define the \textit{cotangent space of $V$} at the origin by \[T^* V = I_V / I_V^2.\]
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
Similarly, a point $f \in V(R[t] / t^2)$ can be written as $f = f(0) + v(f) t$ where $v(f)$ is determined by the image of $f - f(0)$ in $T^* V$.  Hence, we define the \textit{tangent space of $V$} by \[TV = V(R[t] / t^2) \cong \CatOf{Modules}_R(T^* V, R).\]
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}\label{InverseFunctionTheoremForFVars}\citeme{This is 3.1.8 in the Crystals notes.}
A map $f\co V \to W$ of finite--dimensional formal varieties is an isomorphism if and only if the induced map $Tf\co TV \to TW$ is an isomorphism of $R$--modules.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
First, reduce to the case where $V \cong \A^n$ and $W \cong \A^n$ have the same dimension, and select charts for both.  Then, $Tf$ is a matrix of dimension $n \times n$.  If $Tf$ fails to be invertible, we are done, and if it is invertible, we replace $f$ by $f \circ (Tf)^{-1}$ so that $Tf$ is the identity matrix.

We now construct the inverse function by induction on degree.  Set $g^{(1)}$ to be the identity function, so that $f$ and $g^{(1)}$ are mutual inverses when restricted to the first-order neighborhood.  So, suppose that $g^{(r-1)}$ has been constructed, and consider its interaction with $f$ on the $r${\th} order neighborhood: \[g_i^{(r-1)}(f(x)) = x_i + \sum_{|J| = r} c_J x_1^{J_1} \cdots x_n^{J_n} + o(r+1). \]  By adding in the correction term \[g_i^{(r)} = g_i^{(r-1)} - \sum_{|J| = R} c_J x_1^{J_1} \cdots x_n^{J_n},\] we have $g_i^{(r)}(f(x)) = x_i + o(r)$.
\end{proof}

We now return to our motivating example of $\CP^\infty_E$ for $E$ a complex-oriented cohomology theory, where we saw that the complex-orientation determines an isomorphism $\CP^\infty_E \cong \A^1$.  However, the object ``$E^* \CP^\infty$'' is something that exists independent of the orientation map $MU \to E$, and we now have the language to tease apart this situation:
\begin{lemma}
A cohomology theory $E$ is \textit{complex orientable} (i.e., it is able to receive a ring map from $MU$) precisely when $\CP^\infty_E$ is a formal curve.  A choice of map $MU \to E$ determines a coordinate $\CP^\infty_E \cong \A^1$. \qed
\end{lemma}

As we saw in the first case study, $\CP^\infty_E$ has more structure than just a formal scheme: it also carries the structure of a group.  We close today with some remarks about such objects.

\begin{definition}\citeme{Theorem 2.2.6 of the Crystals notes}
A formal group is a formal variety endowed with an abelian group structure.\footnote{Formal groups in dimension $1$ are automatically commutative if and only if the ground ring has no elements which are simultaneously nilpotent and torsion.}
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
As with formal schemes, formal groups can arise as formal completions of an algebraic group at its identity point.  It turns out that there are many more formal groups than come from this procedure, a phenomenon that is of keen interest to stable homotopy theorists.\todo{Add some kind of reference to a complaint about this?  It's not like we're going to talk about $\TMF$ much.}
\end{remark}

\begin{corollary}
As with physical groups, the formal group addition map on $\G$ determines the inverse law.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
Consider the shearing map
\begin{align*}
\G \times \G & \xrightarrow{\sigma} \G \times \G, \\
(x, y) & \mapsto (x, x + y).
\end{align*}
The induced map $T\sigma$ on tangent spaces is evidently invertible, so by \Cref{InverseFunctionTheoremForFVars} there is an inverse map $(x, y) \mapsto (x, y - x)$.  Setting $y = 0$ and projecting to the second factor gives the inversion map.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}\label{FGLDefinition}
Let $\G$ be a formal group.  In the presence of a coordinate $\phi \co \G \cong \A^n$, the addition law on $\G$ begets a map
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
\G \times \G \arrow{r} \arrow[-,double]{d} & \G \arrow[-,double]{d} \\
\A^n \times \A^n \arrow{r} & \A^n,
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
and hence a $n$-tuple of $(2n)$-variate power series ``$+_\phi$'', satisfying
\begin{align*}
\underline{\smash x} +_\phi \underline{\smash y} & = \underline{\smash y} +_\phi \underline{\smash x}, & \text{(commutativity)} \\
\underline{\smash x} +_\phi \underline{\smash 0} & = \underline{\smash x}, & \text{(unitality)} \\
\underline{\smash x} +_\phi (\underline{\smash y} +_\phi \underline{\smash z}) & = (\underline{\smash x} +_\phi \underline{\smash y}) +_\phi \underline{\smash z}. & \text{(associativity)}
\end{align*}
Such a tuple $+_\phi$ is called a \textit{formal group law}.
\end{definition}

Let's now consider two examples of $E$ which are complex-orientable and describe $\CP^\infty_E$ for them.

\begin{example}
There is an isomorphism $\CP^\infty_{H\Z P} \cong \G_a$.  This follows from reasoning identical to that given in \Cref{RPinftyExampleForReal}.
\end{example}

\begin{example}\todo{This calculation ignores the grading, which isn't great notation. Put the Bott class where it belongs}
There is also an isomorphism $\CP^\infty_{KU} \cong \G_m$.  Given a complex line bundle $\L$ over a space $X$, we use the complex orientation of $KU$ where the total Chern class of $\L$ is given by \[c(\L) = 1 - [\L].\]  Given this definition, we perform a manual computation:
\begin{align*}
c(\L_1 \otimes \L_2) & = 1 - [\L_1 \otimes \L_2] = 1 - [\L_1] [\L_2] \\
& = -1 + [\L_1] + [\L_2] - [\L_1] [\L_2] + 1 - [\L_1] + 1 - [\L_2] \\
& = (1 - [\L_1]) + (1 - [\L_2]) - (1 - [\L_1])(1 - [\L_2]) \\
& = c(\L_1) + c(\L_2) - c(\L_1) c(\L_2).
\end{align*}
In this coordinate on $\CP^\infty_{KU}$, the group law is then $x +_! y = x + y - xy$.
\end{example}

We will close today by showing that the rational theory of formal groups is highly degenerate, similar to the rational theory of spectra.

\begin{definition}
The module of \textit{K\"ahler differentials} on a $k$--algebra $R$ is an $R$--module $\Omega^1_{R/k}$.  It is generated by symbols $dr$ for each element $r \in R$, subject to the two families of relations
\begin{align*}
ds & = 0, \, s \in k & \text{(differentiation is linear for ``scalars'')} \\
d(rr') & = rdr' + r'dr. & \text{($d$ is a derivation)}
\end{align*}
Elements of $\Omega^1_{R/k}$ are referred to as \textit{$1$--forms}.
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
The module $\Omega^1_{R/k}$ is universal for derivations into $R$--modules: \[\CatOf{Derivations}_k(R, M) = \CatOf{Modules}_R(\Omega^1_{R/k}, M). \qed\]
\end{lemma}

These definitions are interesting in this level of generality, but suppose now that $k$ is a $\Q$--algebra and that $R = k\llbracket x \rrbracket$ is the coordinatized ring of functions on a formal line over $k$.  What's special about this rational curve case is that differentiation gives an isomorphism between $\Omega^1_{R/k}$ and the ideal $(x)$ of functions vanishing at the origin, i.e., the ideal sheaf selecting the closed subscheme $\Spec k \to \Spf R$.  Its inverse is formal integration: \[\int \co \left(\sum_{j=0}^\infty c_j x^j \right) dx \mapsto \sum_{j=0}^\infty \frac{c_j}{j+1} x^{j+1}.\]

Taking a cue from classical Lie theory, we attempt to define exponential and logarithm functions for a given formal group law $F$.  \todo{We should show here that the submodule of invariant $1$--forms is equivalent to the module of tangent vectors.}This is typically accomplished by studying left--invariant differentials: a $1$--form $f(x) dx$ is said to be left--invariant under $F$ when \[f(x) dx = f(y +_F x) d(y +_F x) = f(y +_F x) \frac{\partial(y +_F x)}{\partial x} dx.\]  Restricting to the origin by setting $y = 0$, we deduce the condition \[f(0) = f(x) \cdot \left. \frac{\partial(y +_F x)}{\partial x} \right|_{y=0}.\]  If $R$ is a $\Q$--algebra, then setting the boundary condition $f(0) = 1$ and integrating against $x$ yields \[\log_F(x) = \int \left( \left. \frac{\partial(y +_F x)}{\partial x} \right|_{y=0} \right)^{-1} dx.\]  To see that the series $\log_F$ has the claimed homomorphism property, note that \[\frac{\partial \log_F(y +_F x)}{\partial x} = f(y +_F x) d(y +_F x) = f(x) dx = \frac{\partial \log_F(x)}{\partial x},\] so $\log_F(y +_F x)$ and $\log_F(x)$ differ by a constant.  Checking at $x = 0$ shows that the constant is $\log_F(y)$, hence \[\log_F(x +_F y) = \log_F(x) + \log_F(y).\]  In all, this argument bundles into the following coordinate-free theorem:
\begin{theorem}\label{RationalFGLsHaveLogarithms}\todo{This feels like a bit of a jump.  ``$\otimes$'', for instance?}
There is a unique isomorphism \[\G \xrightarrow{\log} \operatorname{Lie} \G \otimes \G_a. \qed\]
\end{theorem}







\section{Divisors on formal curves}\citeme{Section 2.4.2 of the AHS preprint}

We now have a solid foundation for the most important case of the complex-oriented cohomology of a space: $E^* \CP^\infty$.  We turn next to an algebro-geometric model for the other topological operation complex-oriented cohomology theories are well-suited for: the formation of Thom complexes.  Recall the theorem from the beginning of last time:
\begin{theorem}[{\Cref{ThomIsomOverC}}]
For a complex vector bundle $\xi$ on a space $X$ and a complex-oriented ring spectrum $E$, there is a natural equivalence \[E \sm T(\xi) \simeq E \sm \Susp^\infty_+ X. \qed\]
\end{theorem}
Recalling also the perspective on modules as quasicoherent sheaves from \Cref{HopfAlgebraLecture}, we are thus moved to study sheaves on $X_E$ which are $1$--dimensional --- i.e., line bundles.  Having said all that, we will leave the topology for tomorrow and focus on the algebra today.  We fix the following three pieces of data:
\begin{itemize}
\item $S$ is our ``base'' formal scheme.
\item $C$ is a formal curve over $S$.
\item $\zeta: S \to C$ is a distinguished point on $C$.
\end{itemize}

Recall that yesterday we defined what it meant for a subscheme to be closed.  The notion of a divisor on a formal curve is a particular sort of closed subscheme:

\begin{definition}\citeme{Def 2.33 of AHS preprint}
An \textit{effective Weil divisor} $D$ on $C$ is a closed $X$--subscheme of $C$ whose structure map $D \to S$ is flat and whose ideal sheaf $\sheaf I_D$ is free of rank $1$ as an $\sheaf{O}_X$--module.  We say that the \textit{rank} of $D$ is $n$ when its ring of functions $\sheaf O_D$ is free of rank $n$ over $\sheaf O_S$.
\end{definition}

Consider the case of interest to us, where we have selected a coordinate $x$ on $C$.  In that case, there are isomorphisms $S = \Spec E_*$ and $C \cong \Spf E^*\ps{x}$, so that a divisor $D$ must be of the form $D \cong \Spf E^*\ps{x} / f$ for some $f$ not a zero-divisor.  We see then that $\sheaf I_D$ corresponds to the principal ideal $E^*\ps{x} \cdot f \cong E^*\ps{x}$, and $D$ is a divisor exactly when $E^*\ps{x} / f$ is a flat $E^*$--module.\todo{Is this last condition easy to unpack?  I'd hope it means something about monicity.}

Before considering their connection to line bundles, we will study the concept of a divisor in isolation.

\begin{lemma}
The scheme of such effective Weil divisors of rank $n$ exists: $\Div_n^+ C$.  It is a formal variety of dimension $n$.  In fact, a coordinate $x$ on $C$ determines an isomorphism $\Div_n^+ C \cong \A^n$.\todo{I wonder if it's possible to frame this argument with \Cref{DetectingFormalVarieties}.  The proof given here is Prop 5.2 of FSFG.}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Begin with the definition \[\Div_n^+(C)(R) = \left\{(a, D) \middle| \begin{array}{c} a: \Spec R \to S, \\ \text{$D$ is an effective divisor on $C \times_S \Spec R$} \end{array} \right\}.\]  To show that it is a formal variety, we pick a coordinate $x$ on $C$ and consider a point $(a, D) \in \Div_n^+(C)(R)$.  In this case, $C \times \Spec R$ is presented as \[C \times_X \Spec R = \Spf R\llbracket x \rrbracket\] and hence $D$ can be presented as the closed subscheme \[D = \Spf R\llbracket x \rrbracket / (x^n - g(x)), \quad g(x) = \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} a_j(D) x^j.\]  One checks that $a_j(D)$ is a nilpotent element of $R$ for all $j$, and hence determines a map $\Spec R \to \A^n$.  Conversely, given such a map, we can form the polynomial $g(x)$ and hence the divisor $D$.
\end{proof}

This proof lays bare the moral value of this scheme: it parametrizes collections of points on $C$ which arise as zero loci of polynomials.  It's well-known how basic operations on polynomials affect their zero loci, and these operations are also reflected on the level of divisor schemes.  For instance, there is a unioning map:
\begin{lemma}
There is a map
\begin{align*}
\Div_n^+ C \times \Div_m^+ C & \to \Div_{n+m}^+ C, \\
(D_n, D_m) & \mapsto D_n \sqcup D_m. \qed
\end{align*}
\end{lemma}
\begin{remark}\label{DescriptionOfSqCupMapOnPolynomials}
On the level of the polynomials $g_n$, $g_m$, and $g_{n+m}$, this map is given by \[(g_n, g_m) \mapsto x^{n+m} - (x^n - g_n(x)) \cdot (x^m - g_m(x)) =: g_{n+m}(x).\]
\end{remark}

Note that there is a canonical isomorphism $C \to \Div_1^+ C$.  Iterating the above addition map gives the vertical map in the following triangle:
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
& C^{\times n} \arrow{ld} \arrow{d} \\
C^{\times n}_{\Sigma_n} \arrow[densely dotted]{r}{\cong} & \Div_n^+ C.
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
\begin{lemma}
The object $C^{\times n}_{\Sigma_n}$ exists, it factors the iterated addition map, and the dotted arrow is an isomorphism. 
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
The first assertion is a consequence of Newton's theorem on symmetric polynomials: the subring of symmetric polynomials in $R[x_1, \ldots, x_n]$ is itself polynomial on generators \[\sigma_j(x_1, \ldots, x_n) = \sum_{\substack{S \subseteq \{1, \ldots, n\} \\ |S| = j}} x_{S_1} \cdots x_{S_j},\] and hence \[R[\sigma_1, \ldots, \sigma_n] \subseteq R[x_1, \ldots, x_n].\]  Picking a coordinate on $C$ allows us to import this fact into formal geometry to deduce the existence of $C^{\times n}_{\Sigma_n}$.  The factorization then follows by noting that the iterated $\sqcup$ map is symmetric.  Finally, \Cref{DescriptionOfSqCupMapOnPolynomials} shows that the horizontal map pulls the coordinate $a_j$ back to $\sigma_j$, so the third assertion follows.
\end{proof}

We now consider the effects of maps $q\co C \to C'$ between curves.
\begin{lemma}\label{DivHasPushforwards}
Let $q\co C \to C'$ be a map of formal curves over $S$, and let $D \subseteq C$ be a divisor on $C$.  Then the composite $D \to C \to C'$, denoted $q_* D$, is also a divisor.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
The structure map map $D \to S$ is unchanged and hence still flat, and the ideal sheaf $\sheaf I_{q_* D} \subseteq \sheaf O_{C'}$ is given by tensoring up the original ideal sheaf: \[\sheaf I_{q_* D} = \sheaf I_D \otimes_{\sheaf O_C} \sheaf O_{C'}.\]  Hence, it is still free of rank $1$.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
For a general map $q$, the pullback $D \times_{C'} C$ of a divisor $D \subseteq C'$ will not be a divisor on $C$.  However, conditions on $q$ can be imposed so that this is so, and in this case $q$ is called an \textit{isogeny}.  We will return to this in the future.
\end{remark}

Now we use the pointing $\zeta: S \to C$.  Together with the $\sqcup$ map, this gives a composite
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
\Div_n^+ C \arrow{r} & C \times \Div_n^+ C \arrow{r} & \Div_1^+ C \times \Div_n^+ C \arrow{r} & \Div_{n+1}^+ C, \\
D \arrow[|->,r] & (\zeta, D) \arrow[|->,r] & ([\zeta], D) \arrow[|->,r] & {[\zeta] \sqcup D}.
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}

\begin{definition}\label{StableDivisorSchemeDefn}
We define the following variants of ``stable divisor schemes'':
\begin{align*}
\Div^+ C & = \coprod_{n \ge 0} \Div_n^+ C, \\
\Div_n C & = \colim \left( \Div_n^+ C \xrightarrow{[\zeta] + -} \Div_{n+1}^+ C \xrightarrow{[\zeta] + -} \cdots \right), \\
\Div C & = \colim \left( \Div^+ C \xrightarrow{[\zeta] + -} \Div^+ C \xrightarrow{[\zeta] + -} \cdots \right) \\
& \cong \coprod_{n \in \Z} \Div_n C.
\end{align*}
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
The scheme $\Div^+ C$ models the free formal monoid on the formal curve $C$.  The scheme $\Div C$ models the free formal group on the formal curve $C$.  The scheme $\Div_0 C$ simultaneously models the free formal monoid and the free formal group on the \emph{pointed} formal curve $C$. \qed \todo{Can you at least see where the negation maps would come from w/o reference to coalgebras? (See FPFP Prop 18.1?)}
\end{theorem}
\noindent We will postpone the proof of this theorem until later, once we've developed a theory of coalgebraic formal schemes.\oweproof{The various $\Div$ constructions give free monoids / groups}

\begin{remark}
This gives another way to interpret \Cref{DivHasPushforwards}.  A map $q\co C \to C'$ postcomposes to give a map $C \to C' \to \Div C'$.  Since the target of this map is a formal group scheme, university induces a map $q_*\co \Div C \to \Div C'$.
\end{remark}

To close today, we finally link divisors to the study of line bundles.

\begin{definition}\citeme{Def 2.38 of AHS preprint}
Suppose that $\L$ is a line bundle on $C$ and select a section $u$ of $\L$.  There is a largest closed subscheme $D \subseteq C$ where the condition $u|_D = 0$ is satisfied.  If $D$ is a divisor, $u$ is said to be \textit{divisorial} and $D = \div u$.
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}\citeme{Def 2.38 of AHS preprint}
Let $u$ be a divisorial section of $\L$.  Then, $u$ gives a trivialization of $\L \otimes \sheaf I_D$, so that $\L \cong \sheaf I_D^{-1}$. \qed
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}
This construction is suitably monoidal: if $u$ and $v$ are divisorial sections of $\sheaf L$ and $\sheaf M$ respectively, then $u \otimes v$ is a divisorial section of $\sheaf L \otimes \sheaf M$ and $\div(u \otimes v) = \div u + \div v$. \qed
\end{lemma}

This Lemma induces us to consider the extension of this concept to meromorphic functions:
\begin{definition}
A \textit{meromorphic divisorial section} of a line bundle $\sheaf L$ is a decompositon $\sheaf L \cong \sheaf L_1 \otimes \sheaf L_2^{-1}$ together with an expression of the form $u_+ / u_-$, where $u_+$ and $u_-$ are divisorial sections of $\sheaf L_1$ and $\sheaf L_2$ respectively.  We set $\div(u_+ / u_-) = \div u_+ - \div u_-$.
\end{definition}

The fundamental theorem is that, in the case of a curve $C$, meromorphic functions (sometimes called ``Cartier divisors'') and Weil divisors essentially agree.

\begin{definition}
The ring of meromorphic functions on $C$, $\sheaf{M}_C$, is obtained by inverting all coordinates in $\sheaf{O}_C$.\footnote{In fact, it suffices to invert any single one.}
\end{definition}

A particular meromorphic function spans a $1$--dimensional $\sheaf O_C$--submodule sheaf of $\sheaf M_C$, and hence it determines a line bundle.  Conversely, a line bundle is determined by local gluing data, which is exactly the data of a meromorphic function.  However, it is clear that there is some overdeterminacy in this first operation: scaling a meromorphic function by a nowhere vanishing entire function will not modify the submodule sheaf.  This suggests the following operation: to a meromorphic function $f$, we assign the difference of its zero locus and its infinite locus, considered as a divisor.  This determines a map \[\sheaf M_C^\times \to (\Div C)(S).\]

\begin{definition}
We then augment this to a scheme $\operatorname{Mer}(C, \mathbb G_m)$ of meromorphic functions on $C$ by \[\operatorname{Mer}(C, \mathbb G_m)(R) := \left\{ (u, f) \middle| \begin{array}{c} u: \Spec R \to S, \\ f \in \sheaf{M}^\times_{C \times \Spec R} \end{array} \right\}.\]
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}\citeme{This is Prop 5.26 in FSFG.}
In the case of a formal curve $C$, there is a short exact sequence of formal groups \[0 \to \InternalHom{FormalSchemes}(C, \mathbb G_m) \to \operatorname{Mer}(C, \mathbb G_m) \to \Div(C) \to 0.\]
\end{theorem}







\section{Projectivization and Thom spaces}\citeme{Section 8 of the $H_\infty$ AHS paper.}
\todo{This title needs improvement.}

Today we will exploit all of the algebraic geometry we set up yesterday to deduce a load of topological results.  

\begin{definition}
Let $E$ be a complex-orientable theory and let $V \to X$ be a complex vector bundle over a space $X$.  According to \Cref{ThomIsomOverC}, the cohomology of the Thom space $E^* T(V)$ forms a $1$--dimensional $E^* X$--module.  We denote the associated line bundle over $X_E$ by $\ThomSheaf{V}$.
\end{definition}

\begin{corollary}\citeme{Make backreferences.}
This construction enjoys many properties already established:
\begin{itemize}
\item If $f \co X \to Y$ is a map and $V$ is a virtual bundle over $Y$, then there is an isomorphism \[\ThomSheaf{f^* V} \cong (f_E)^* \ThomSheaf{V}.\]
\item (\Cref{ThomSpacesAreMonoidal}) There is a canonical isomorphism \[\ThomSheaf{V \oplus W} = \ThomSheaf{V} \otimes \ThomSheaf{W}.\]
\item This property can then be used to extend the definition of $\ThomSheaf{V}$ to virtual bundles: $\ThomSheaf{V - W} = \ThomSheaf{V} \otimes \ThomSheaf{W}^{-1}$.
\qed
\end{itemize}
\end{corollary}

\begin{remark}
The utility of this definition is that it only uses the \emph{property} that $E$ is complex-orientable, and it begets only the \emph{property} that $\ThomSheaf{V}$ is a line bundle.
\end{remark}

The following example begs to be worked, and it connects our topic with that of \Cref{FormalVarietiesLecture}.
\begin{example}
If $\L$ denotes the canonical line bundle over $\CP^\infty$, then the zero section identifies $E^0 (\CP^\infty)^{\L}$ with the augmentation ideal in $E^0 \CP^\infty$, and so we have an isomorphism $\ThomSheaf{\L} \cong \sheaf I(0)$.  Then, consider the map $\eps: * \to \CP^\infty$, which classifies a line bundle that Thomifies to $\CP^1 \to \CP^\infty$.  Using naturality, we see \[\widetilde{\pi_2 E} \cong \ThomSheaf{* \to \CP^\infty} \cong 0^* \sheaf I(0) \cong \omega_{\G_E},\] where $\G_E = \CP^\infty_E$ is the formal group associated to $E$--theory and $\omega_{\G_E}$ is its sheaf of invariant differentials.  More generally, if $k \eps$ is the trivial bundle of dimension $k$ over a point, then $\ThomSheaf{k \eps} \cong \omega_{\G_E}^k$.  If $f \co E \to F$ is an $E$--algebra (e.g., $F = E^{X_+}$), then this gives an interpretation of $\pi_{2k} F$ as $f_E^* \omega_{\G_E}^k$.
\end{example}

Our discussion yesterday centered on an equivalent presentation of line bundles on a formal curve: their corresponding divisors.  Following that cue, we now seek out a topological construction on vector bundles $V \to X$ which produces finite schemes over $X_E$.  A quick browse through the literature will lead one to the following:
\begin{definition}
Let $\xi$ be a complex vector bundle of rank $n$ over a base $X$.  Define $\P(xi)$, the \textit{projectivization of $\xi$}, to be the $\CP^{n-1}$--bundle over $X$ whose fiber of $x \in X$ is the space of complex lines in the original fiber $\xi|_x$.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}\label{CohomologyOfProjectivization}
The $E$--cohomology of $\P(\xi)$ is given by the formula \[E^* \P(\xi) \cong \left. E^*(X) \llbracket x \rrbracket \middle/ c(\xi) \right.\] for a certain monic polynomial \[c(\xi) = x^n - c_1(\xi) x^{n-1} + c_2 x^{n-2} - \cdots + (-1)^n c_n(\xi).\]
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
We fit all of the fibrations we have into a single diagram:
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
& \C^\times \arrow[-,double]{dd} \arrow{rd} \\
\C^n \arrow{dd} & & \C^n \setminus \{0\} \arrow[crossing over]{ll} \arrow{r} \arrow{dd} & \CP^{n-1} \arrow{r} \arrow{dd} & \CP^\infty \arrow[-,double]{dd} \\
& \C^\times \arrow{rd} \\
\xi \arrow{d} & & \xi \setminus \zeta \arrow{ll} \arrow{r} \arrow{d} & \P(\xi) \arrow{r} \arrow{d}{\pi} & \CP^\infty \arrow{d} \\
X \arrow[-,double]{rr} \arrow[bend left, densely dotted]{u}{\zeta} & & X \arrow[-,double]{r} & X \arrow{r} & *.
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
We read this diagram as follows: on the far left, there's the vector bundle we began with, as well as its zero-section $\zeta$.  Deleting the zero-section gives the second bundle, a $\C^n \setminus \{0\}$--bundle over $X$.  Its quotient by the scaling $\C^\times$--action gives the third bundle, a $\CP^{n-1}$--bundle over $X$.  Additionally, the quotient map $\C^n \setminus \{0\} \to \CP^{n-1}$ is itself a $\C^\times$--bundle, and this induces the structure of a $\C^\times$--bundle on the quotient map $\xi \setminus \zeta \to \P(\xi)$.  Thinking of these as complex line bundles, they are classified by a map to $\CP^\infty$, which can itself be thought of as the last vertical fibration, fibering over a point.

Note that the map between these two last fibers is surjective on $E$--cohomology.  It follows that the Serre spectral sequence for the third vertical fibration is degenerate, since all the classes in the fiber must survive.\footnote{This is called the Leray--Hirsch theorem.}  We thus conclude that $E^* \P(\xi)$ is a free $E^*(X)$--module on the classes $\{1, x, x^2, \ldots, x^{n-1}\}$ spanning $E^* \CP^{n-1}$.  To understand the ring structure, we need only compute $x^{n-1} \cdot x$, which must be able to be written in terms of the classes which are lower in $x$--degree: \[x^n = c_1(\xi) x^{n-1} - c_2 x^{n-2} + \cdots + (-1)^{n-1} c_n(\xi)\] for some classes $c_i(\xi) \in E^* X$.  The theorem follows.
\end{proof}

We have a triple of obvious corollaries:
\begin{corollary}[{\Cref{CohomologyOfProjectivization} redux}]
The map \[P(\xi)_E \to X_E \times \CP^\infty_E\] is a closed inclusion of $X_E$--schemes.  In fact, $P(\xi)_E$ is a divisor on $\CP^\infty_E$. \qed
\end{corollary}
\begin{corollary}
The map $E^* X \to E^* \P(\xi)$ is injective, and $E^* \P(\xi)$ is a finite free $E^* X$--module. \qed
\end{corollary}
\begin{corollary}
A line bundle canonically splits off of $\pi^*(\xi)$: consider the sub-bundle of vectors $(v, (\ell, x))$ such that $v$ lies along the line $\ell$. \qed
\end{corollary}

\noindent Combining these and iterating gives something much stronger:

\begin{corollary}[``Splitting principle'' / ``Complex--oriented descent'']
Associated to any $n$--dimensional complex vector bundle $\xi$ over a base $X$, there is a canonical map $i_\xi: Y_\xi \to X$ such that $(i_\xi)_E\co (Y_\xi)_E \to X_E$ is finite and faithfully flat, and there is a canonical splitting into complex line bundles: \[i_\xi^*(\xi) \cong \bigoplus_{i=1}^n \L_i. \qed\]
\end{corollary}

This Corollary is extremely important.  Its essential contents is to say that any question about characteristic classes can be checked for sums of line bundles.  Specifically, because of the injectivity of $i_\xi^*$, any relationship among the characteristic classes deduced in $E^* Y_\xi$ must already be true in the ring $E^* X$.  The following theorem is a consequence of this principle:

\begin{theorem}\todo{Proposition 8.31 in FSFG shows that the isomorphism $BU(n)_E \cong \Div_n^+ \CP^\infty_E$ is independent of coordinate. Read it.}
The coset fibration \[U(n-1) \to U(n) \to S^{2n-1}\] deloops to a spherical fibration \[S^{2n-1} \to BU(n-1) \to BU(n).\]  The associated Serre spectral sequence \[E_2^{*, *} = H^*(BU(n); E^* S^{2n-1}) \Rightarrow E^* BU(n-1)\] degenerates at $E_{2n}$ and induces an isomorphism \[E^* BU(n) \cong E^* \llbracket \sigma_1, \ldots, \sigma_n\rrbracket.\]  Now, let $\xi: X \to BU(n)$ classify a vector bundle $\xi$.  Then the coefficient $c_j$ in the polynomial $c(\xi)$ is selected by $\sigma_j$: \[c_j(\xi) = \xi^*(\sigma_j).\]
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}[Proof sketch]
The first part is a standard calculation.  To prove the relation between the Chern classes and the $\sigma_j$, the splitting principle states that we can factor complete the map $\xi: X \to BU(n)$ to a square
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
Y_\xi \arrow{d}{f_\xi} \arrow[densely dotted]{r}{\bigoplus_{i=1}^n \L_i} & BU(1)^{\times n} \arrow{d}{\oplus} \\
X \arrow{r}{\xi} & BU(n).
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
The equation $c_j(f_\xi^* \xi) = \xi^*(\sigma_j)$ can be checked in $E^* Y_\xi$.
\end{proof}

We now see that not only does $\P(V)_E$ produce a point of $\Div_n^+(\G_E)$, but actually the scheme $\Div_n^+(\G_E)$ itself appears internally to topology:

\begin{corollary}
For a complex orientable cohomology theory $E$, there is an isomorphism \[BU(n)_E \cong \Div_n^+ \CP^\infty_E,\] so that maps $\xi: X \to BU(n)$ are transported to divisors $\P(\xi)_E \subseteq \CP^\infty_E \times X_E$.  Selecting a particular complex orientation of $E$ begets two isomorphisms
\begin{align*}
BU(n)_E & \cong \A^n, &
\Div_n^+ \CP^\infty_E & \cong \A^n,
\end{align*}
and these are compatible with the centered isomorphism above. \qed
\end{corollary}

What's most remarkable about the description in this theorem is its coherence with topological facts we know about $BU(n)$.  The theorem follows from the projectivization construction, but there are natural operations on both sides of the isomorphism that continue to match up.  For instance, the Whitney sum map $BU(n) \times BU(m) \to BU(n+m)$ has the following behavior:

\begin{lemma}\label{WhitneySumOfDivisors}
The sum map \[BU(n) \times BU(m) \xrightarrow\oplus BU(n+m)\] induces on Chern polynomials the identity \[c(\xi \oplus \zeta) = c(\xi) \cdot c(\zeta).\]  In terms of divisors, \[\P(\xi \oplus \zeta)_E = \P(\xi)_E \sqcup \P(\zeta)_E,\] and hence there is an induced square
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
BU(n)_E \times BU(m)_E \arrow{r}{\oplus} \arrow[-,double]{d} & BU(n+m) \arrow[-,double]{d} \\
\Div_n^+ \CP^\infty_E \times \Div_m^+ \CP^\infty_E \arrow{r}{\sqcup} & \Div_{n+m}^+ \CP^\infty_E. \qed
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
\end{lemma}

The following is a consequence of combining this Lemma with the splitting principle:

\begin{corollary}
The map $Y_E \xrightarrow{f_\xi} X_E$ pulls $\P(\xi)_E$ back to give \[Y_E \times_{X_E} \P(\xi)_E \cong \bigoplus_{i=1}^n \left\{ c_1(\L_i) \right\}. \qed\]
\end{corollary}

\noindent This is to say that the splitting principle is a topological reflection (or, better, a topological enhancement) of the claim that a divisor base-changed to a separably closed field will split as a sum of points.

The other theorems from yesterday are also easily matched up with topological counterparts:

\begin{corollary}
There are natural isomorphisms $BU_E \cong \Div_0 \CP^\infty_E$ and $(BU \times \Z)_E \cong \Div \CP^\infty_E$. Additionally, $(BU \times \Z)_E$ is the free formal group on the curve $\CP^\infty_E$. \qed
\end{corollary}

\begin{corollary}
There is a commutative diagram
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
BU(n)_E \times BU(m)_E \arrow{r}{\otimes} \arrow[-,double]{d} & BU(nm)_E \arrow[-,double]{d} \\
\Div_n^+ \CP^\infty_E \times \Div_m^+ \CP^\infty_E \arrow{r}{\cdot} & \Div_{nm}^+ \CP^\infty_E,
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
where the bottom map acts by \[(D_1, D_2 \subseteq \CP^\infty_E \times X_E) \mapsto (D_1 \times D_2 \subseteq \CP^\infty_E \times \CP^\infty_E \xrightarrow{\mu} \CP^\infty_E).\]
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
By the splitting principle, it is enough to check this on sums of line bundles.  A sum of line bundles corresponds to a totally decomposed divisor, and on a pair of such divisors $\bigsqcup_{i=1}^n [a_i]$ and $\bigsqcup_{j=1}^m [b_j]$, the map acts by \[\left(\bigsqcup_{i=1}^n [a_i] \right) \left( \bigsqcup_{j=1}^m [b_j] \right) = \bigsqcup_{i, j} [\mu_{\CP^\infty_E}(a_i, b_j)]. \qedhere\]
\end{proof}

Finally, we can connect our analysis of the divisors coming from topological vector bundles with the line bundles studied at the start of the section.  Suppose that $V$ is a line bundle over $X$, classified by a map $\xi \co X \to \CP^\infty$.  In terms of algebraic geometry, the map $b$ defines an $X_E$--valued point $b = b_E$ of $\G$, and it follows that \[\ThomSheaf{V} \cong b^* \sheaf I(0) \cong 0^* \sheaf I(-b).\]  Next, consider the line bundle $V \otimes \L$ over $X \times \CP^\infty$.  Then $\ThomSheaf{V \otimes \L}$ is pulled back from $\sheaf I_{\G} (0)$ along the map \[X_E \times \G \xrightarrow{b \times 1} \G \times \G \xrightarrow{\mu} \G,\] from which it follows that \[\ThomSheaf{V \otimes \L} \cong T_b^* \sheaf I(0) = \sheaf I_{X_E \times \G}(-b).\]  More generally, suppose $V = \bigoplus_i n_i \L_i$ is a virtual sum of line bundles over $X$.  The line bundles $\L_i$ define points $b_i$ of $\G$ over $X_E$, and the bundle $V$ determines the divisor $D = \sum_i n_i [b_i]$.  Together, this means \[\ThomSheaf{V \otimes \L} = \sheaf I_{X_E \times \G}(-D).\]  By the splitting principle, $\ThomSheaf{V \otimes \L}$ can be computed in this manner even when $V$ is not a virtual sum of line bundles: the divisor associated to $\sheaf I_{(Y_\xi)_E \times \G}(-D)$ descends to $X_E \times \G$, even if none of its points do.  Finally, pulling back along the map \[X_E \times * \xrightarrow{\id \times 0} X_E \times \G\] describes $\ThomSheaf{V}$ as the restriction of the ideal sheaf of $\P(V)$ along the zero-section of $\G_E$.
\todo{You didn't say anything about $\P(V)$ until the very last line, so this is clearly incomplete.}


\todo{I think another definition of the Thom space is as the cofiber of $\P(V) \to \P(V \oplus \C)$.  This might come in handy.}

\todo{Say that the top Chern class is the Euler class / the Thom class.}









\section{Operations and a model for cobordism}

Our eventual goal, like last time, is to give an algebro-geometric description of $MU_*(*)$ and of the cooperations $MU_* MU$.  There is such a description that passes through the Adams spectral sequence, also like last time, but $MU_*(*)$ is an integral algebra and so we cannot make do with working out the mod--$2$ Adams spectral sequence.  We would have to at least work out the mod--$p$ Adams spectral sequence for every $p$, but there is the following unfortunate theorem:
\begin{theorem}
There is an isomorphism
\[H\F_pP_0 H\F_pP \cong \F_p[\xi_0^\pm, \xi_1, \xi_2, \ldots] \otimes \Lambda[\tau_0, \tau_1, \ldots]\]
with $|\xi_j| = 2p^j-2$ and $|\tau_j| = 2p^j - 1$. \qed
\end{theorem}
\noindent Because we are no longer working in characteristic $2$ and because there are odd--dimensional classes in this algebra, we see that the dual mod--$p$ Steenrod algebra is \emph{graded-commutative}.  This is the first time we have encountered Hindrance \#\ref{SkewCommutativeDeficiency} from \Cref{TheSteenrodAlgebraSection} in the wild, and for now we will simply avoid these methods and find another approach.

There is such an alternative proof, due to Quillen, that bypasses the Adams spectral sequence.  This approach has some deficiencies of its own: it requires studying the algebra of operations $MU^* MU$, which we do not expect to be at all commutative, and it requires studying \textit{power operations}, which are in general very technical creatures.  However, we will eventually want to talk about power operations anyway, and because this is the road less traveled we will elect to take it.  Our job today is to define these two kinds of cohomology operations, as well as revisit the model of complex cobordism Quillen uses.

The description of the first class of operations follows immediately from our discussion of complex cobordism up to this point, so we will begin there.  We learned last time that for any complex-orientable cohomology theory $E$ we have the calculation \[E^* BU \cong E^*\llbracket \sigma_1, \sigma_2, \ldots, \sigma_j, \ldots\rrbracket,\] and we gave a rich interpretation of this in terms of divisor schemes: \[BU_E \cong \Div_0 \CP^\infty_E.\]  Two lectures ago, we learned that the stable divisor scheme has a universal property: it is the free formal group on the formal curve $\CP^\infty_E$.  Another avatar of this same fact is a description of the \emph{homology ring}, using the maps \[E_* BU(n) \otimes E_* BU(m) \to E_* BU(n+m)\] to induce a multiplicative structure on $E_* BU$:
\begin{corollary}
Let $E$ be a complex-orientable cohomology theory. Then: \[E_* BU \cong \Sym_{E_*} \widetilde E_* \CP^\infty.\]  A specific complex orientation of $E$ begets \[E_* \CP^\infty = E_*\{\beta_0, \beta_1, \ldots, \beta_n, \ldots\}\] and hence \[E_* BU = \Sym_{E_*} E_*\{\beta_1, \beta_2, \ldots\} = E_*[b_1, b_2, \ldots]. \qed\]
\end{corollary} \oweproof{Free formal schemes agree with symmetric Hopf algebras on comodules}

Thomifying these ``$\oplus$'' maps gives maps \[E_* MU(n) \otimes E_* MU(m) \to E_* MU(n+m),\] and the naturality of the $E$--Thom isomorphism produces an additional corollary:
\begin{corollary}
The Thom isomorphism $E_* BU \cong E_* MU$ respects both the $E_*$--module structure and the ring structure.  Hence, \[E_* MU \cong E_*[c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_n, \ldots],\] where $c_j$ is the image of $b_j$ under the Thom map. \qed
\end{corollary}

\todo{A corollary of the splitting principle is supposed to be that a Thom isomorphism for $\CP^\infty$ begets Thom isomorphisms for everything, and hence a ring spectrum map $MU \to E$.  We should produce that corollary now.  This is Lemma II.4.6 in Adams's blue book.}

\noindent This compact description of $E_* MU$ as an algebra will be useful to us later, but right now we are interested in $E^* MU$ and especially in $MU^* MU$.  The former is \emph{not} a ring, and although the latter is a ring its multiplication is exceedingly complicated.  Instead, we will content ourselves with an $E_*$--module basis:
\begin{definition}
Let $\alpha = (\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_n, \ldots)$ denote a multi-index where every entry is nonnegative and almost every entry is zero, and let $c_\alpha$ denote the corresponding monomial \[c_\alpha = \prod_{j=1}^\infty c_j^{\alpha_j}.\]  Additionally, we let $s_\alpha \in E^* MU$ denote the image of $c_\alpha$ under the Thom isomorphism.  It is called the \textit{$\alpha${\th} Landweber--Novikov operation}.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}\citeme{I.5.1 in Adams's blue book}
Let $E = MU$.  The Landweber--Novikov operations are the \emph{stable} operations acting on $MU$--cohomology, analogous to the Steenrod operations we started the semester talking about.  They satisfy the following properties:
\begin{itemize}
\item $s_0$ is the identity.
\item $s_\alpha$ is natural: $s_\alpha(f^* x) = f^*(s_\alpha x)$.
\item $s_\alpha$ is stable: $s_\alpha(\sigma x) = \sigma(s_\alpha x)$.
\item $s_\alpha$ is additive: $s_\alpha(x + y) = s_\alpha(x) + s_\alpha(y)$.
\item $s_\alpha$ satisfies a Cartan formula.  Define \[s_{\t}(x) = \sum_\alpha s_\alpha(x) \cdot t_1^{\alpha_1} t_2^{\alpha_2} \cdots t_n^{\alpha_n} \cdots =: \sum_{\alpha} s_\alpha(x) \t^\alpha\] for an infinite sequence of indeterminates $t_1$, $t_2$, \ldots.  Then: \[s_{\t}(x y) = s_{\t}(x) \cdot s_{\t}(y).\]
\item Let $\xi: X \to BU(n)$ classify a vector bundle and let $\phi$ denote the Thom isomorphism \[\phi: MU^* X \to MU^* T(\xi).\]  Then the Chern classes of $\xi$ are related to the Landweber--Novikov operations on the Thom spectrum by the formula \[\sum_\alpha \phi c_\alpha(\xi) \t^\alpha = \sum_\alpha s_\alpha \phi(1) \t^\alpha.\]
\end{itemize}
\end{remark}

We now turn to the construction of the power operations.  Power operations get their name from their \emph{multiplicative} properties, and correspondingly we do not (\textit{a priori}) expect them to be additive operations, so they are quite distinct from the Landweber--Novikov operations produced above.  Power operations arise from ``$E_\infty$'' structures on ring spectra\footnote{Or, by some accounts, ``$H_\infty$'' structures.}, but most such structures arise in nature from geometric models of cohomology theories.  To produce them for complex cobordism, we will use a particular model, alluded to in \Cref{IntroductionSection}.

\begin{definition}
Let $f: Y \to X$ be a map of manifolds.  A \textit{complex-orientation on the map $f$} is the data of a factorization
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
 & E \arrow{d} \\
Y \arrow{r}{f} \arrow[densely dotted]{ru}{i} & X
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
through a complex vector bundle $E$ on $X$ such that $i$ is an embedding and its normal bundle $\nu_i$ has a complex structure.\todo{Account for the odd-dimensional case and the dimension-jumping case.}  Two such factorizations are \textit{equivalent} when they appear as subbundles of a larger bundle and the embeddings are isotopic, compatibly with the structures on their normal bundles.
\end{definition}
\begin{lemma}
For $\dim E \gg 0$, this equivalence class is unique, if it exists. \qed
\end{lemma}
\begin{definition}
Two complex-oriented maps $f_0: Y_0 \to X$ and $f_1: Y_1 \to X$ are called \textit{cobordant} when there is a complex-oriented map $W \to X \times \R$ and elements $b_0, b_1 \in \R$ such that
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
Y_0 \arrow{r} \arrow{d} & X \times \{b_0\} \arrow{d} & Y_1 \arrow{r} \arrow{d} & X \times \{b_1\} \arrow{d} \\
W \arrow{r} & X \times \R & W \arrow{r} & X \times \R
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
become pull-back squares of complex-oriented maps of manifolds.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Thom]
For a manifold $X$, $MU^{-q}(X)$ is canonically isomorphic to the cobordism classes of complex-oriented maps of dimension $q$. \qed
\end{theorem}

\begin{remark}
This model has a variety of nice features.  For instance, its two variances are visible from the construction: a map $g: X' \to X$ induces a map $g^*: MU^* X \to MU^* X'$ by selecting a class $f: Y \to X$, perturbing $g$ so that it is transverse to $f$, and taking the pullback
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
Y \times_X X' \arrow{r} \arrow{d} & Y \arrow{d} \\
X' \arrow{r} & X.
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
But, also, if $g$ is additionally proper and complex-orientable, then it induces a map $g_*: MU^q X' \to MU^{q-d} X$, where $d$ is the dimension of $g$.  This is simply by postcomposition: a representative $f': Y' \to X'$ begets a new representative $g_* f' = g \circ f'$.\todo{Give this a name: Gysin, pushforward, shriek, \ldots}
\end{remark}

In fact, these push and pull maps are related by a formula:
\begin{lemma}\label{PushPullFormulaForMU}
Consider a Cartesian square of manifolds
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
Y \times_X Z \arrow{r}{g'} \arrow{d}{f'} & Z \arrow{d}{f} \\
Y \arrow{r}{g} & X,
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
where $g$ is transversal to $f$, $f$ is proper and complex-oriented, and $f'$ is endowed with the pull-back of the complex orientation of $f$. Then \[g^* f_* = f'_* (g')^*: h(Z) \to h(Y). \qed\]
\end{lemma}


We are now in a position to describe our power operations.
\begin{definition}\label{DefnPowerOperationForMU}
Consider a class in $U^{-2q}(X)$ represented by a proper complex-oriented map $f \co Y \to X$.  Its $n$--fold Cartesian product determines a class $f^{\times n} \co Y^{\times n} \to X^{\times n}$, and taking the homotopy quotient by a group $G$ acting on $\{1, \ldots, n\}$ gives a class \[Y^{\times n} \to X^{\times n} \to EG \times_G X^{\times n}\] and hence an \textit{external power operation} \[P^{\mathrm{ext}} \co MU^{-2q}(X) \to MU^{-2qn}(EG \times_G X^{\times n}).\]  Pulling back along the diagonal $\Delta: X \to X^{\times n}$ gives the the \textit{internal power operation} \[P \co MU^{-2q}(X) \to MU^{-2qn}(BG \times X).\]  Its action on the class represented by a proper complex-oriented even-dimensional map $f: Z \to X$ can also be written as \[P(f_* 1) = \Delta^* f^{\times n}_{hG}{}_* 1.\]
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
It's apparent that we've really needed this geometric model to accomplish this construction: we needed to understand how to take Cartesian powers of maps in a way that inherited a $G$--action.  This is not data that a ring spectrum is naturally equipped with, and if we were to tease out exactly what extra information we need to encode this operation, we would eventually arrive at the notion of an $E_\infty$--ring spectrum.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
A picky reader will (rightly) point out that $BG$ is not a manifold, and so we shouldn't be mixing it with out geometric model for $MU$.  This is a fair point, but since $BG$ can be approximated through any cellular dimension by a manifold, we won't worry about it.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
The chain model for ordinary homology is actually rigid enough to define power operations there, too.  Curiously, they are all generated by the quadratic power operations (i.e., the ``squares''), and all the quadratic power operations turn out to be \emph{additive} --- that is, you just get the Steenrod squares again!  This appears to be a curious degeneracy, but over the coming days we will exploit something similar with a very particular power operation in complex cobordism.

\section{Quillen's theorem}

\todo{Danny pointed out that this is a little confused about fixed points versus orbits and homotopy vs genuine.  Make sure this is straightened out.}

Our goal today is to apply a version of \Cref{PushPullFormulaForMU} to the push-pull definition of the power operation for $MU$ given in \Cref{DefnPowerOperationForMU}.  The relevant Cartesian square in that case has the form
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
W \arrow{r} \arrow{d}{g} & EG \times_G \arrow{d}{f^{\times k}_{hG}} \\
BG \times X \arrow{r}{\Delta} & EG \times_G X^{\times k}.
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
However, since the vertical map $f^{\times k}_{hG}$ is not an inclusion, we can't rely on \todo{Wait, why can't we just use \Cref{PushPullFormulaForMU}?}  So, we investigate the following slightly more general situation.

\begin{definition}
Let $X$ be a manifold.  Two closed submanifolds $Y$ and $Z$ are said to \textit{intersect cleanly} when $W = Y \cap Z$ is a submanifold and for each $w \in W$, the tangent space of $W$ at $w$ is given by $T_w W = T_w Y \cap T_w X$.  In this case, we draw a Cartesian square
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
W \arrow{r}{j'} \arrow{d}{i'} & Z \arrow{d}{i} \\
Y \arrow{r}{j} & X.
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
The \textit{excess bundle} of the intersection, $F$, is defined by the exact sequence
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
& & (i')^* TY \arrow{rd} \\
0 \arrow{r} & \nu_{i'} \arrow{rr} \arrow{ru} & & (j')^* \nu_i \arrow{r} & F \arrow{r} & 0.
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
$Y$ and $Z$ intersect transversally exactly when $F = 0$.
\end{remark}

\begin{lemma}\label{CleanIntersectionFormula}\citeme{Proposition 3.3 of Quillen}\needproof{Euler classes}
Suppose that $\nu_{i'}$, $\nu_i$, and $F$ are endowed with complex structures compatible with this exact sequence. For $z \in MU^*(Z)$, \[j^* i_* z = i'_*(e(F) \cdot (j')^* z)\] in $MU^{*+a}(Y, Y \setminus W)$, where $a = \dim \nu_i$. \qed \todo{The proof of this is easy, but not very relevant to formal geometry. Let's skip it and give a reference.}
\end{lemma}

Now let $G$ be a finite group and let $i: Z \to X$ be an embedding of $G$--manifolds. Then the $G$--fixed submanifold $X^G$ and $Z$ intersect cleanly in the diagram
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
Z^G \arrow{r}{r_Z} \arrow{d}{i^G} & Z \arrow{d}{i} \\
X^G \arrow{r}{r_X} & X.
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
Since $r_Z^*(\nu_i)$ is a $G$--bundle over a trivial $G$ space, there is a decomposition $r_Z^*(\nu_i) = \nu_{i^G} \oplus \mu_i$, where $\nu_{i^G}$ has no $G$--action and $\mu_i = F$, the excess bundle, carries all of the nontrivial $G$--action.  Applying $EG \times_G (-)$ to the diagram and picking $z \in MU^*(EG \times_G Z)$, \Cref{CleanIntersectionFormula} then gives \[r_X^* i_* z = i^G_*(e(\mu_i) \cdot r_Z^* z) \in MU^*(BG \times X^G, (BG \times X^G) \setminus (BG \times Z^G)).\]  Replacing the embedding condition with orientability, this gives the following:

\begin{lemma}\label{ProperCOIntersectionFormula}\citeme{Proposition 3.8 of Quillen}
Let $f: Z \to X$ be a proper complex-oriented $G$-map, represented by a factorization \[Z \xrightarrow i E \xrightarrow p X.\]  Let $\mu(E)$ be excess summand of $r_X^* E$ corresponding to the part of $E$ on which $G$ acts nontrivially, where, as before, $r_X$ is the inclusion of the fixpoint submanifold $X^G \subseteq X$.  Then, for $z \in MU^*(EG \times_G Z)$, we have: \[e(\mu(E)) \cdot r_X^* f_* z = f^G_*(e(\mu_i) \cdot r_Z^* z) \in MU^*(BG \times X^G). \qed\]
\end{lemma}

We are now in a position to apply \Cref{ProperCOIntersectionFormula} to our power operation square.

\begin{lemma}\label{PowerOpAndEulerClasses}\citeme{Proposition 3.12 of Quillen}
Suppose $G$ acts transitively on $\{1, \ldots, k\}$ and let $\rho$ denote the induced reduced regular $G$-representation. Suppose that $f: Z \to X$ is a proper complex-oriented map of dimension $2q$ and that $m$ is an integer larger than the dimension of $Z$, so that $m \eps + \nu_f$ is a vector bundle over $Z$, well-defined up to isomorphism, where $\eps$ is the trivial complex line bundle. Then \[e(\rho)^m P(f_* 1) = f_* e(\rho \otimes (m \eps + \nu_f)) \in MU^{2m(k-1)-2qk}(BG \times X).\]
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
We can take $m$ large enough that the complex-orientation on $f$ can be represented by a factorization \[Z \xrightarrow i m \eps \xrightarrow p X,\] and consider its $k${\th} power \[Z^{\times k} \xrightarrow{i^{\times k}} (m \eps)^{\times k} \xrightarrow{p^{\times k}} X^{\times k}.\]  We calculate the excess bundles to be
\begin{align*}
\mu_{i^{\times k}} & = \rho \otimes \nu_i, &
\mu((m \eps)^{\times k}) & = \rho \otimes m \eps.
\end{align*}
Since $G$ acts transitively, $\Delta: X \to X^{\times k}$ represents the inclusion of the $G$--fixed points.  Packaging all this into \Cref{ProperCOIntersectionFormula} gives \[e(\rho \otimes m\epsilon) \cdot \Delta^* f^{\times k}_{hG}{}_*(1) = f_*(e(\rho \otimes \nu_i) \cdot r_{W \to Z^{\times k}}^*(1)).\]
We then investigate each part separately:
\begin{align*}
e(\rho \otimes m\eps) & = e(\rho^{\oplus m}) = e(\rho)^m, &
\Delta^* f^{\times k}_{hG} {}_*(1) & = P(f_* 1), \\
e(\rho \otimes \nu_i) & = e(\rho \otimes (m \eps + \nu_f)), &
r^*_{W \to Z^{\times k}}(1) & = 1
\end{align*}
from which the claim follows.
\end{proof}

The utility of this theorem comes from our ability to compute just a little bit about the Euler classes involved in its statement.
\begin{corollary}\citeme{Quillen Prop 3.17}
\todo{Should we use $a_\alpha(v)$ as the notation?} \todo{In previous sections, you've been using $\xi$ to denote arbitrary vector bundles, not $E$.}Specialize to $G = C_k$, and let $\eta$ denote the line bundle on $BG$ owing to the inclusion $C_k \subseteq U(1)$.  Set $e(\eta) = v$ and $e(\rho) = w$.  Then, the Steenrod operation and Landweber operations are related by the formula \[w^{r+q} P x = \sum_{|\alpha| \le r} w^{r - |\alpha|} a(v)^\alpha s_\alpha(x)\] for $x \in MU^{-2q}(X)$ and $r$ is any integer sufficiently large with respect to $\dim X$ and $q$, where $a_j(T)$ are power series with coefficients in the subring $C$ generated by the tautological formal group law on $MU^*(*)$.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
The bundle $\rho$ splits as $\bigoplus_{i=1}^{k-1} \eta^{\otimes i}$.  Then, if $\L$ is any other line bundle with a trivial $G$--action,
\begin{align*}
e(\rho \otimes \L) & = e \left( \bigoplus_{i=1}^{k-1} \eta^i \otimes \L \right) = \prod_{i=1}^{k-1} e(\eta^i \otimes \L) \\
& = \prod_{i=1}^{k-1} F([i]_F(v), e(\L)) = w + \sum_{j=1}^\infty a_j(v) e(\L)^j,
\end{align*}
where \[w = e(\rho) = (k-1)! v^{k-1} + \sum_{j \ge k} b_j v^j\] for $b_j \in C$.  In general, the splitting principle shows that $e(\rho \otimes E)$ has \[e(\rho \otimes E) = \sum_{|\alpha| \le r} w^{r-|\alpha|} a(v)^\alpha c_\alpha(E).\]  Setting $E = m \eps + \nu_f$, we calculate $r = \dim(m \eps + \nu_f) = m - q$.  Inserting this into \Cref{PowerOpAndEulerClasses} then gives
\begin{align*}
w^m P(f_* 1) & = f_* \left( \sum_{|\alpha| \le r} w^{r - |\alpha|} a(v)^\alpha c_\alpha(m \eps + \nu_f) \right) \\
w^{r+q} P(f_* 1) & = \sum_{|\alpha| \le r} w^{r - |\alpha|} a(v)^\alpha f_* c_\alpha(m \eps + \nu_f) \\
& = \sum_{|\alpha| \le r} w^{r - |\alpha|} a(v)^\alpha s_\alpha(f_* 1). \qedhere
\end{align*}
\todo{Check that this last line is right. Can you pull Gysin maps past Euler classes?  What happened to $m \eps$? --- are you using the definition of Landweber--Novikov operations for $\nu_i$ instead of $\nu_f$?  Why?}
\end{proof}



\begin{theorem}\citeme{Quillen Theorem 5.1}
If $X$ is the homotopy type of a finite complex, then
\begin{align*}
MU^*(X) & = C \cdot \sum_{q \ge 0} MU^q(X), \\
\widetilde{MU}^*(X) & = C \cdot \sum_{q > 0} MU^q(X).
\end{align*}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
We can focus on \[\widetilde{MU}^{2*}(X) = C \cdot \sum_{q > 0} MU^{2q}(X) =: R^{2*},\] since $MU^{2*+1}(*) = 0$ and $\widetilde{MU}^{2*+1}(X)$ can be handled by suspending $X$ once, and then the unreduced case follows directly.  We will show this by inducting on the value of ``$*$'': suppose that \[R^{-2j}_{(p)} = \widetilde{MU}^{-2j}(X)_{(p)}\] for $j < q$ and consider $x \in \widetilde{MU}^{-2q}(X)$.  Then, for $n \gg 0$, we have \[w^{n+q} P x = \sum_{|\alpha| \le n} w^{n - |\alpha|} a(v)^\alpha s_\alpha x.\]  Recall that $w$ is a power series in $v$ with coefficients in $C$ and leading term $(p-1)! v^{p-1}$, so that $v^{p-1} = w \cdot \theta(v)$ for some invertible series $\theta$ with coefficients in $C$.  Since $s_\alpha$ lowers degree, we have $s_\alpha x \in R$ by the inductive hypothesis, so \[v^m(w^qPx - x) = \psi_x(v)\] for $\psi_x(T) \in R_{(p)}\llbracket T \rrbracket$.

Suppose $m \ge 1$ is the least integer for which we can write such an equation.  Applying the inclusion $i: X \to X \times B\Z/p$ to this equation sets $v = 0$ and yields $\psi(0) = 0$, hence $\psi_x(T) = T \omega_x(T)$ and \[v (v^{m-1}(w^qPx - x) - \omega_x(v)) = 0.\]  Since $v$ annihilates this equation, we can use the Gysin sequence associated to the spherical bundle \[S^1 \to B\Z/p \to \CP^\infty\] to produce a class $y \in \widetilde{MU}^{2(m-1)-2q}(X)$ with \[v^{m-1}(w^q P x - x) = \psi_1(x) + y \<p\>(v).\]  If $m > 1$, then $y \in R$ for degree reasons and hence the right-hand side gives an equation contradicting our minimality hypothesis.  So, $m = 1$, and the outer factor of $v^{m-1}$ is not present.  Restricting along $i$ again, we obtain the equation \[\left. \begin{array}{rr} -x & \text{if $q > 0$} \\ x^p - x & \text{if $q = 0$} \end{array} \right\} = \psi_1(0) + py.\]

In the first case, where $q > 0$, it follows that $MU^{-2q}(X) \subseteq R^{-2q} + pMU^{-2q}(X)$, and since $MU^{-2q}(X)$ has finite order torsion, it follows that $MU^{-2q}(X) = R^{-2q}$.  In the other case, $x \mapsto x^p - x$ kills $\widetilde{MU}^0(X)/(R^0 + p\widetilde{MU}^0(X))$.  But the ideal $\widetilde{MU}^0(X)$ is nilpotent, so $x \mapsto x^p$ is a nilpotent endomorphism of $\widetilde{MU}^0(X) / p\widetilde{MU}^0(X)$.  So, it follows that $\widetilde{MU}^0(X) = R^0$, and induction proves the theorem.\todo{I feel I don't understand the algebra in this second case.}
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}\label{QuillenSurjective}
The map $Laz \to MU^*$ is surjective. \qed
\end{corollary}

This is motivation enough for us to investigate the moduli of formal groups.  We will soon strengthen \Cref{QuillenSurjective} to show that this map is an isomorphism.

\todo{I moved the logarithms discussion into \Cref{FormalVarietiesLecture}, so we could now prove this strengthening too...}

\todo[inline]{There's buzz about a ``Frobenius map'' for structured rings going around these days. I guess the point is that an $E_2$--algebra structure is enough to get a multiplicative map $E^0 X \to E^0 X \otimes E^0 BC_p$. This isn't additive, so it can't come from an infinite loop map, but it becomes additive when passing to the Tate construction: $E^X \to (E^X)^{tC_p}$, using the fact that the genuine $C_p$ fixed points of $E^{X^{\times p}}$ is $E^X$, and the square relating genuine, homotopy, and geometric fixed points.  Mike has been claiming that these results of Quillen's can be interpreted in this way, but I'm not sure what the interpretation is.  He says it has something to do with inverting the Euler class and the part of Quillen's argument that involves walking down the multiples of Euler classes on both sides of the equation.}

\todo{Section II.6 of Adams's blue book talks about $\pi_* E \sm MU$.}

\begin{remark}
\todo[inline]{Remark that this analysis works for $MO$ too, and it's even easier since there $2 = 0$.  On the other hand, this doesn't work for $MSp$ or $MSO$ --- why?  Conversely, there's something special about the universal example.  Every complex-oriented theory has Chern classes, and they always push forward to give cohomology operations $MU \to E$, but you can't compose those.  Also, every complex-oriented theory has certain cohomology classes representable as $f_* 1$ for a complex-oriented map of manifolds $W \to Z$, but only for $MU$ is this exhaustive. (In Matt's published thesis he cites ``Thom's theorem'', [Tho51], for this result.)}

wrong-way maps: $\zeta^* \zeta_* 1$ gives the Euler class of the bundle

Explicit Thom isomorphism map for universal cohomology: $\xi: X \to BU(n)$ Thomifies to $T(\xi) \to MU(n) \to MU$, representing a class $g \in MU^* T(\xi)$, and this gives a map
\begin{align*}
MU^*(X) & \to MU^* T(\xi) & \cong MU^*(E, E_0)\\
x & \mapsto & g \smile p^*(x),
\end{align*}
where $p: E \to X$ is the projection and $E_0$ is the image of the zero section.

The wrong--way maps come from conjugating by Poincar\'e duality: \[E^* X \cong E_{d_X-*} X \to E_{d_X-*} Y \cong E^*{*-d_X+d_Y} Y.\]  Poincar\'e duality comes from asserting that the stable normal bundle is oriented for the theory, and then Atiyah duality says \[D(X_+) \simeq \Susp^{-n} T(\nu) [\simeq T(\nu - n\eps) \simeq T(-\tau)]. \]

------

Q: Once you know that $MU$ has the universal formal group law on it, does the description of $MU_* MU$ follow immediately from evenness?  Probably?\todo{No, it follows from \emph{freeness}, and this should go into the operations/model section.}

-----

Need to talk about Gysin pushforwards in complex bordism and in ordinary cohomology.  Compare these with the theory of Thom isomorphism in general.  They're equivalent, right?  A complex orientation makes proper maps induce shriek maps, and shriek maps can be used to deduce what Chern classes are by push-pull: if $\zeta: X \to E$ is the zero section of a complex bundle $\xi$, then $e(\xi) = i^* i_*(1)$ I think.
