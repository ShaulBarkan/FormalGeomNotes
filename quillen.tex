\chapter{Complex bordism}\label{ComplexBordismChapter}


\todo{Write an introduction for me.}


\section{Feb 8: Formal varieties}

Having totally dissected unoriented bordism, we can now turn our attention to other sorts of bordism theories, and there are many available: oriented, $\Spin$, $\String$, complex, \ldots.  We would like to replicate the results from \Cref{UnorientedBordismChapter} for these other contexts, but we quickly see that only one of the listed bordism theories supports this program.  The space $\RP^\infty = BO(1)$ was a key player in the unoriented bordism story, and the only other bordism theory with a similar ground object is complex bordism, with $\CP^\infty = BU(1)$.  So, we will focus on it.

The contents of \Cref{LectureThomSpectra} can be replicated essentially \textit{mutatis mutandis}, resulting in the following theorems:
\begin{theorem}
There is a complex $J$--homomorphism \[J_{\C}: BU \to B \GL_1 \S. \qed \]
\end{theorem}

\begin{definition}
The associated Thom spectrum is written ``$MU$'' and called \textit{complex bordism}.  A map $MU \to E$ of ring spectra is said to be a \textit{complex orientation of $E$}.\todo{Something I've seen more than once is an equivalence $MU(k) \simeq BU(k) / BU(k-1)$. It's not immediately obvious to me where this comes from. Where does it come from? Is it helpful to think about?}
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
For a complex vector bundle $\xi$ on a space $X$ and a complex-oriented ring spectrum $E$, there is a natural equivalence \[E \sm T(\xi) \simeq E \sm \Susp^\infty_+ X. \qed\]
\end{theorem}

\begin{corollary}\label{CPinftyNiceCalculation}
In particular, it follows that $E^* \CP^\infty$ is isomorphic to a one--dimensional power series ring for a complex-oriented ring spectrum $E$. \qed
\end{corollary}

In light of these theorems, it seems prudent to develop some of the theory of formal schemes and formal varieties.

\begin{definition}
Fix a scheme $S$.  A formal $S$--scheme $X = \{X_\alpha\}_\alpha$ is an ind-system of Artinian $S$--schemes $X_\alpha$.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
In the case $S = \Spec k$ for a field $k$, ``Artinian'' means that $\sheaf{O}_{X_\alpha}$ is a finite--dimensional $k$--vector space.
\end{remark}

These ind-systems arise when studying completions of rings.  To address the geometric situation, we first owe ourselves a definition of a closed subscheme, which we've somehow avoided up until this point:
\begin{definition}
Let $X$ be an affine formal scheme, and pick a chart $\Spec R \to X$.  A subscheme $Y \subseteq X$ is called \textit{closed} when it has the form
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
Y \arrow{r} \arrow[-,double,densely dotted]{d} & X \arrow[-,double]{d} \\
\Spec (R/I) \arrow{r} & \Spec R.
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
\end{definition}

There's a dual notion of an open subscheme, which we will continue to avoid for now.  These definitions are both best stated in a coordinate--free way, but the open subscheme version really \emph{requires} it, so we will postpone it until later.\oweproof{Definition of open scheme}\oweproof{Definition of closed subscheme without chart}  For now, we will proceed with the geometry:

\begin{definition}
Consider such a closed subscheme $Y$ of an affine $S$--scheme $X$, modeled by a map $\Spec R/I \to \Spec R$.  We define the \textit{$n${\th} order neighborhood of $Y$ in $X$} to be the scheme $\Spec R/I^{n+1}$.  The \textit{formal neighborhood of $Y$ in $X$} is then the ind-system \[X^\wedge_Y := \left\{ \Spec R/I \to \Spec R/I^2 \to \Spec R/I^3 \to \cdots \right\}.\]
\end{definition}

\noindent So, formal schemes arise naturally when studying the local geometry of $X$ near a subscheme $Y$.  An exceedingly common situation is for $X$ to be a variety and $Y$ to be a smooth point, so that $X^\wedge_Y$ looks like ``a small piece of affine space''.  We pin this important case down with a definition:

\begin{definition}
In the case that $S = \Spec R$ is affine, formal affine $n$--space over $S$ is defined by \[\A^n = \Spf R\llbracket x_1, \ldots, x_n\rrbracket.\]  A \textit{formal affine variety} is a formal scheme $V$ which is (noncanonically) isomorphic to $\A^n$ for some $n$.  The two maps in an isomorphism pair \[V \to \A^n, \quad V \leftarrow \A^n\] are called a coordinate (system) and a parameter (system) respectively.
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}\label{MapsOfFVarsArePowerSeries}
A map $\A^n \to \A^m$ is specified by an $m$--tuple of $n$--variate power series. \qed \todo{Prove this?}
\end{lemma}

\begin{remark}
In some sense, \Cref{MapsOfFVarsArePowerSeries} is a full explanation for why anyone would even think to involve formal geometry in algebraic topology (nevermind how useful the program has been in the long run).  Calculations in algebraic topology are frequently expressed in terms of power series rings, and with this Lemma formal geometry promises to give geometric interpretations to such objects.
\end{remark}

\Cref{MapsOfFVarsArePowerSeries} shows how formal varieties are especially nice, because maps between them can be boiled down to statements about power series.  In particular, this allows theorems from analytic differential geometry to be imported, including a version of the inverse function theorem, which we will now work towards.

\begin{definition}
Let $V$ be a formal variety and let $I_V = \A^1(V)$ be the ideal of functions vanishing at the origin.  Then, we define the \textit{cotangent space of $V$} at the origin by \[T^* V = I_V / I_V^2.\]
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
Similarly, a point $f \in V(R[t] / t^2)$ can be written as $f = f(0) + v(f) t$ where $v(f)$ is determined by the image of $f - f(0)$ in $T^* V$.  Hence, we define the \textit{tangent space of $V$} by \[TV = V(R[t] / t^2) \cong \CatOf{Modules}_R(T^* V, R).\]
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}\label{InverseFunctionTheoremForFVars}\citeme{This is 3.1.8 in the Crystals notes.}
A map $f: V \to W$ of finite--dimensional formal varieties is an isomorphism if and only if the induced map $Tf: TV \to TW$ is an isomorphism of $R$--modules.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
First, reduce to the case where $V \cong \A^n$ and $W \cong \A^n$ have the same dimension, and select charts for both.  Then, $Tf$ is a matrix of dimension $n \times n$.  If $Tf$ fails to be invertible, we are done, and if it is invertible, we replace $f$ by $f \circ (Tf)^{-1}$ so that $Tf$ is the identity matrix.

We now construct the inverse function by induction on degree.  Set $g^{(1)}$ to be the identity function, so that $f$ and $g^{(1)}$ are mutual inverses when restricted to the first-order neighborhood.  So, suppose that $g^{(r-1)}$ has been constructed, and consider its interaction with $f$ on the $r${\th} order neighborhood: \[g_i^{(r-1)}(f(x)) = x_i + \sum_{|J| = r} c_J x_1^{J_1} \cdots x_n^{J_n} + o(r+1). \]  By adding in the correction term \[g_i^{(r)} = g_i^{(r-1)} - \sum_{|J| = R} c_J x_1^{J_1} \cdots x_n^{J_n},\] we have $g_i^{(r)}(f(x)) = x_i + o(r)$.
\end{proof}

We now return to our motivating example of $\CP^\infty_E$ for $E$ a complex-oriented cohomology theory, where we saw that the complex-orientation determines an isomorphism $\CP^\infty_E \cong \A^1$.  However, the object ``$E^* \CP^\infty$'' is something that exists independent of the orientation map $MU \to E$, and we now have the language to tease apart this situation:
\begin{lemma}
Suppose that $E$ is a \textit{complex orientable} cohomology theory, i.e., it is able to receive a ring map from $MU$.  In that case, $\CP^\infty_E$ is a formal curve.  A choice of map $MU \to E$ determines a coordinate $\CP^\infty_E \cong \A^1$. \qed
\end{lemma}

As we saw in the first case study, $\CP^\infty_E$ has more structure than just a formal scheme: it also carries the structure of a group.  We close today with some remarks about such objects.

\begin{definition}\citeme{Theorem 2.2.6 of the Crystals notes}
A formal group is a formal variety endowed with an abelian group structure.\footnote{Formal groups in dimension $1$ are automatically commutative if and only if the ground ring has no elements which are simultaneously nilpotent and torsion.}
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
As with formal schemes, formal groups can arise as formal completions of an algebraic group at its identity point.  It turns out that there are many more formal groups than come from this procedure, a phenomenon that will be of keen interest to us.
\end{remark}

\begin{definition}
Let $\G$ be a formal group.  In the presence of a coordinate $\phi \co \G \cong \A^n$, the addition law on $\G$ begets a map
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
\G \times \G \arrow{r} \arrow[-,double]{d} & \G \arrow[-,double]{d} \\
\A^n \times \A^n \arrow{r} & \A^n,
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
and hence a $n$-tuple of $(2n)$-variate power series ``$+_\phi$'', satisfying
\begin{align*}
\underline{\smash x} +_\phi \underline{\smash y} & = \underline{\smash y} +_\phi \underline{\smash x}, & \text{(commutativity)} \\
\underline{\smash x} +_\phi \underline{\smash 0} & = \underline{\smash x}, & \text{(unitality)} \\
\underline{\smash x} +_\phi (\underline{\smash y} +_\phi \underline{\smash z}) & = (\underline{\smash x} +_\phi \underline{\smash y}) +_\phi \underline{\smash z}. & \text{(associativity)}
\end{align*}
Such a tuple $+_\phi$ is called a \textit{formal group law}.
\end{definition}

\begin{corollary}
The formal group addition map on $\G$ determines the inverse law.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
Consider the shearing map
\begin{align*}
\G \times \G & \xrightarrow{\sigma} \G \times \G, \\
(x, y) & \mapsto (x, x + y).
\end{align*}
The induced map $T\sigma$ on tangent spaces is evidently invertible, so by \Cref{InverseFunctionTheoremForFVars} there is an inverse map $(x, y) \mapsto (x, y - x)$.  Setting $y = 0$ and projecting to the second factor gives the inversion map.
\end{proof}

To close today, let's consider two examples of $E$ which are complex-orientable and describe $\CP^\infty_E$ for them.

\begin{example}
There is an isomorphism $\CP^\infty_{H\Z P} \cong \G_a$.  This follows from reasoning identical to that given in \Cref{RPinftyExampleForReal}.
\end{example}

\begin{example}
There is also an isomorphism $\CP^\infty_{KU} \cong \G_m$.  Given a complex line bundle $\L$ over a space $X$, we use the complex orientation of $KU$ where the total Chern class of $\L$ is given by \[c(\L) = 1 - \beta[\L].\]  Given this definition, we perform a manual computation:
\begin{align*}
c(\L_1 \otimes \L_2) & = 1 - \beta [\L_1 \otimes \L_2] = 1 - \beta^2 [\L_1] [\L_2] \\
& = -1 + \beta[\L_1] + \beta[\L_2] - \beta^2 [\L_1] [\L_2] + 1 - \beta[\L_1] + 1 - \beta[\L_2] \\
& = (1 - \beta[\L_1]) + (1 - \beta[\L_2]) - (1 - \beta[\L_1])(1 - \beta[\L_2]) \\
& = c(\L_1) + c(\L_2) - c(\L_1) c(\L_2).
\end{align*}
In this coordinate on $\CP^\infty_{KU}$, the group law is then $x +_! y = x + y - xy$.\todo{This calculation is malformed.}
\end{example}


-----



Quillen's theorem needs to know that rational formal groups have logarithms.  Now is a good time to prove that?  Or maybe this comes later.  If it comes here, it would be good to give the version that uses the tangent space:
\begin{theorem}
There is a unique isomorphism \[\G \xrightarrow{\log} \operatorname{Lie} \G \otimes \G_a.\]
\end{theorem}

\begin{definition}
The module of K\"ahler differentials on a $k$--algebra $R$ is given by \todo{Put formula here.}.
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
It's universal for derivations.  It has something to do with cotangent vectors.
\end{lemma}

Sheaves on formal schemes too?





\section{Feb 10: Divisors and divisor schemes}

Today won't really involve any algebraic topology.  Instead, we are going to talk about a certain class of subschemes called ``divisors''.  These play an important role in the theory of complex-oriented cohomology theories, and they're sufficiently complicated that they deserve their own day.  Throughout today, we will have fixed the following three pieces of data:
\begin{itemize}
\item $X$ is our ``base'' formal scheme.
\item $C$ is a formal curve over $X$.
\item $\zeta: X \to C$ is a distinguished point on $C$.
\end{itemize}

Recall that yesterday we defined what it meant for a subscheme to be closed.  \todo{Section 2.4.2 of the AHS preprint treats divisors in more generality. This might make the tail of this section smoother, in trade for having to specialize at the beginning.}  The notion of a divisor on a formal curve is a particular sort of closed subscheme:

\begin{definition}
An \textit{effective Weil divisor} of rank $n$ on $C$ is an $X$--subscheme of $C$ whose ring of functions is rank $n$ as an $\sheaf{O}_X$--module.
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
The scheme of such effective Weil divisors of rank $n$ exists: $\Div_n^+ C$.  It is a formal variety of dimension $n$.  In fact, a coordinate $x$ on $C$ determines an isomorphism $\Div_n^+ C \cong \A^n$.\todo{I wonder if it's possible to frame this argument with \Cref{DetectingFormalVarieties}.  The proof given here is Prop 5.2 of FSFG.}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Begin with the definition \[\Div_n^+(C)(R) = \left\{(a, D) \middle| \begin{array}{c} a: \Spec R \to X, \\ \text{$D$ is an effective divisor on $C \times_X \Spec R$} \end{array} \right\}.\]  To show that it is a formal variety, we pick a coordinate $x$ on $C$ and consider a point $(a, D) \in \Div_n^+(C)(R)$.  In this case, $C \times_X \Spec R$ is presented as \[C \times_X \Spec R = \Spf R\llbracket x \rrbracket\] and hence $D$ can be presented as the closed subscheme \[D = \Spf R\llbracket x \rrbracket / (x^n - g(x)), \quad g(x) = \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} a_j(D) x^j.\]  One checks that $a_j(D)$ is a nilpotent element of $R$ for all $j$, and hence determines a map $\Spec R \to \A^n$.  Conversely, given such a map, we can form the polynomial $g(x)$ and hence the divisor $D$.
\end{proof}

This proof lays bare the moral value of this scheme: it parametrizes collections of points on $C$ which arise as zero loci of polynomials.  It's well-known how basic operations on polynomials affect their zero loci, and these operations are also reflected on the level of divisor schemes.  For instance, there is a unioning map:
\begin{lemma}
There is a map
\begin{align*}
\Div_n^+ C \times_X \Div_m^+ C & \to \Div_{n+m}^+ C, \\
(D_n, D_m) & \mapsto D_n \sqcup D_m. \qed
\end{align*}
\end{lemma}
\begin{remark}\label{DescriptionOfSqCupMapOnPolynomials}
On the level of the polynomials $g_n$, $g_m$, and $g_{n+m}$, this map is given by \[(g_n, g_m) \mapsto x^{n+m} - (x^n - g_n(x)) \cdot (x^m - g_m(x)) =: g_{n+m}(x).\]
\end{remark}

Note that there is a canonical isomorphism $C \to \Div_1^+ C$.  Iterating the above addition map gives the vertical map in the following triangle:
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
& C^{\times_X n} \arrow{ld} \arrow{d} \\
C^{\times_X n}_{\Sigma_n} \arrow[densely dotted]{r}{\cong} & \Div_n^+ C.
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
\begin{lemma}
The object $C^{\times n}_{\Sigma_n}$ exists, it factors the iterated addition map, and the dotted arrow is an isomorphism. 
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
The first assertion is a consequence of Newton's theorem on symmetric polynomials: the subring of symmetric polynomials in $R[x_1, \ldots, x_n]$ is itself polynomial on generators \[\sigma_j(x_1, \ldots, x_n) = \sum_{\substack{S \subseteq \{1, \ldots, n\} \\ |S| = j}} x_{S_1} \cdots x_{S_j},\] and hence \[R[\sigma_1, \ldots, \sigma_n] \subseteq R[x_1, \ldots, x_n].\]  Picking a coordinate on $C$ allows us to import this fact into formal geometry to deduce the existence of $C^{\times n}_{\Sigma_n}$.  The factorization then follows by noting that the iterated $\sqcup$ map is symmetric.  Finally, \Cref{DescriptionOfSqCupMapOnPolynomials} shows that the horizontal map pulls the coordinate $a_j$ back to $\sigma_j$, so the third assertion follows.
\end{proof}

\todo[inline]{We could also talk about functoriality for stable divisor schemes. Given a map $q: C \to C'$, we postcompose to get a map $C \to C' \to \Div C'$ and hence an induced free map $q_*: \Div C \to \Div C'$ which acts by $q_*[a] = [q(a)]$.  Also, if $q$ is an \textit{isogeny}, then there is a map $q^*: \Div C' \to \Div C$ given by Cartesian pullback of schemes and using the isogeny condition to guarantee that the pullback scheme still has a good rank over $\sheaf{O}_X$.}

Now we use the pointing $\zeta: X \to C$.  Together with the $\sqcup$ map, this gives a composite
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
\Div_n^+ C \arrow{r} & C \times_X \Div_n^+ C \arrow{r} & \Div_1^+ C \times_X \Div_n^+ C \arrow{r} & \Div_{n+1}^+ C, \\
D \arrow[|->,r] & (\zeta, D) \arrow[|->,r] & ([\zeta], D) \arrow[|->,r] & {[\zeta] \sqcup D}.
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}

\begin{definition}\label{StableDivisorSchemeDefn}
We define the following variants of ``stable divisor schemes'':
\begin{align*}
\Div^+ C & = \coprod_{n \ge 0} \Div_n^+ C, \\
\Div_n C & = \colim \left( \Div_n^+ C \xrightarrow{[\zeta] + -} \Div_{n+1}^+ C \xrightarrow{[\zeta] + -} \cdots \right), \\
\Div C & = \colim \left( \Div^+ C \xrightarrow{[\zeta] + -} \Div^+ C \xrightarrow{[\zeta] + -} \cdots \right) \\
& \cong \coprod_{n \in \Z} \Div_n C.
\end{align*}
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
The scheme $\Div^+ C$ models the free formal monoid on the formal curve $C$.  The scheme $\Div C$ models the free formal group on the formal curve $C$.  The scheme $\Div_0 C$ simultaneously models the free formal monoid and the free formal group on the \emph{pointed} formal curve $C$. \qed \todo{Can you at least see where the negation maps would come from w/o reference to coalgebras? (See FPFP Prop 18.1?)}
\end{theorem}
\noindent We will postpone the proof of this theorem until later, once we've developed a theory of coalgebraic formal schemes.\oweproof{The various $\Div$ constructions give free monoids / groups}

We close today by justifying the name ``divisor'' that we've been using.  It means something in algebraic geometry, and it's not immediately clear that we are respecting their language.  Line bundles are the most basic objects in their divisor story.  The data of a line bundle turns out to be equivalent to the data of a certain meromorphic function\todo{How does this comparison work again?} up to suitable equivalence.  From that meromorphic function, one can extract a Weil divisor by considering its loci of zeroes and poles.  In our case of a formal curve $C$, we will show that these data all agree.

\begin{definition}
Let $X$ be a formal scheme and $C$ a formal curve over $X$ with ring of functions $\sheaf{O}_C$.  The ring of meromorphic functions on $C$, $\sheaf{M}_C$, is obtained by inverting all coordinates in $\sheaf{O}_C$.  We then augment this to a scheme $\operatorname{Mer}(C, \mathbb G_m)$ of meromorphic functions on $C$ by \[\operatorname{Mer}(C, \mathbb G_m)(R) := \left\{ (u, f) \middle| \begin{array}{c} u: \Spec R \to X, \\ f \in \sheaf{M}^\times_{C \times_X \Spec R} \end{array} \right\}.\]
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}\todo{FSFG Lemma 5.23}
Let $x$ be a coordinate on $C$ and let $f(x) = \sum_{k \in \Z} a_k x^k$ be an element of $\sheaf M_C$.  Then $f$ is invertible in $\sheaf M_C$ if and only if the base scheme $X$ can be written as a coproduct $X = \coprod_{k \in \Z} X_k$ where $X_k = \emptyset$ a.e., such that $a_j$ is nilpotent on $X_k$ for $j < k$, and $a_k$ is invertible on $X_k$. \qed
\end{lemma}

\begin{definition}\todo{FSFG Definition 5.24}
Let $x$ be a coordinate on $C$ and let $f$ be an invertible element of $\sheaf M_C$ with associated decomposition $X = \coprod_k X_k$.  If $X = X_k$ we say $f$ has constant degree $k$, and more generally we have a map $X \to \underline{\Z}$ selecting the local degree.
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}\todo{FSFG Definition 5.25}\todo{This involves Weierstrass.}
Let $x$ be a coordinate on $C$ and let $f$ be an invertible element of $\sheaf M_C$ with constant degree $k$.  Then there is a unique factorization \[f(x) = x^k u(x) g(x)\] for $u(x) \in \sheaf O_C^\times$ and $g(x) = \sum_{j \ge 0} b_j x^{-j}$, $b_0 = 1$, $b_j$ nilpotent for $j > 0$, and $b_j = 0$ for $j \gg 0$. \qed
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}
\todo{This is Prop 5.26 in FSFG.}
In the case of a formal curve $C$, there is a short exact sequence of formal groups \[0 \to \InternalHom{FormalSchemes}(C, \mathbb G_m) \to \operatorname{Mer}(C, \mathbb G_m) \to \Div(C) \to 0.\]
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
One first checks that it suffices to invert \emph{any} one coordinate in forming $\sheaf{M}_C$ and the rest automatically become inverted.  The above lemma gives a decomposition \[\operatorname{Mer}(C, \mathbb G_m) \cong \InternalHom{FormalSchemes}(C, \mathbb G_m) \times \underline{\Z} \times Y,\] where $Y$ selects the series $g$.  For $f(x) \in \sheaf O_{C \times_X \Spec R}$ so that $\sheaf O_{C \times_X \Spec R} / f$ is free of rank $n$ over $R$, we set $\div(f)$ to be the associated divisor, and we extend to fractions by $\div(f/g) = \div(f) - \div(g)$.  This map has kernel $\InternalHom{FormalSchemes}(C, \mathbb G_m)$.

Now let $j: C \to \Div C$ be the usual inclusion, and for a point $a \in C(R)$ set $\sigma(a) = x - x(a) = x(1 - x(a)/x) \in \operatorname{Mer}(C, \mathbb G_m)(R)$.  This gives a map $\sigma: C \to \operatorname{Mer}(C, \mathbb G_m)$ satisfying $\div \circ \sigma = j$.  There is also an extension \[ \tau: \Div C \to \operatorname{Mer}(C, \mathbb G_m),\] and one checks $\tau \circ j = \sigma$.  It follows that $\div \circ \tau \circ j = j$ and thus $\div \circ \tau = 1$.  So, the sequence is split exact, though the formula for the splitting (and only the splitting) involved the coordinate $x$.
\end{proof}

\todo{This is still missing a little.  Include how you take a meromorphic function and build a line bundle?}

\todo{FPFP section 17 is also a reference for this. It's a lot shorter than Chapter 5 of FSFG. Strip it for ideas. The main one seems to be an abbreviated statement of the Weierstrass decomposition of a meromorphic function.}







\section{Feb 12: Chern classes and divisor schemes}\todo{This title needs improvement.}

Having built up some of the background theory of formal varieties, today we're going to pursue another standard calculation for complex-oriented cohomology theories $E$.  Recall our motivating theorem:
\begin{corollary}[{\Cref{CPinftyNiceCalculation}}]
A complex-oriented ring spectrum $E$ imbues $E^* \CP^\infty$ with an isomorphism to a one--dimensional power series ring. \qed
\end{corollary}

\noindent Recalling $\CP^\infty \simeq BU(1)$, we turn to calculating the $E$--cohomology of the other spaces $BU(n)$ in this sequence.  Since these serve as classifying spaces for complex vector bundles, such a calculation will give us a theory of $E$--characteristic classes for complex vector bundles.

\begin{lemma}\label{ECohomologyOfBUn}
The coset fibration \[U(n-1) \to U(n) \to S^{2n-1}\] deloops to a spherical fibration \[S^{2n-1} \to BU(n-1) \to BU(n).\]  The associated Serre spectral sequence \[E_2^{*, *} = H^*(BU(n); E^* S^{2n-1}) \Rightarrow E^* BU(n-1)\] degenerates at $E_{2n}$ and induces an isomorphism \[E^* BU(n) \cong E^* \llbracket \sigma_1, \ldots, \sigma_n\rrbracket. \qed\]
\end{lemma}

Our goal is to imbue \Cref{ECohomologyOfBUn} with algebro-geometric meaning.  This will come out of investigating a related nest of theorems, generally referred to as ``the splitting principle''.  Begin by considering the following construction:
\begin{definition}
Let $\xi$ be a complex vector bundle of rank $n$ over a base $X$.  Define $\P(xi)$, the \textit{projectivization of $\xi$}, to be the $\CP^{n-1}$--bundle over $X$ whose fiber of $x \in X$ is the space of complex lines in the original fiber $\xi|_x$.\todo{I think another definition of the Thom space is as the cofiber of $\P(V) \to \P(V \oplus \C)$.  This might come in handy.}
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}\label{CohomologyOfProjectivization}
The $E$--cohomology of $\P(\xi)$ is given by the formula \[E^* \P(\xi) \cong \left. E^*(X) \llbracket x \rrbracket \middle/ c(\xi) \right.\] for a certain monic polynomial \[c(\xi) = x^n - c_1(\xi) x^{n-1} + c_2 x^{n-2} - \cdots + (-1)^n c_n(\xi).\]
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
We fit all of the fibrations we have into a single diagram:
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
& \C^\times \arrow[-,double]{dd} \arrow{rd} \\
\C^n \arrow{dd} & & \C^n \setminus \{0\} \arrow[crossing over]{ll} \arrow{r} \arrow{dd} & \CP^{n-1} \arrow{r} \arrow{dd} & \CP^\infty \arrow[-,double]{dd} \\

X \arrow[-,double]{rr} \arrow[bend left, densely dotted]{u}{\zeta} & & X \arrow[-,double]{r} & X \arrow{r} & *.
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
We read this diagram as follows: on the far left, there's the vector bundle we began with, as well as its zero-section $\zeta$.  Deleting the zero-section gives the second bundle, a $\C^n \setminus \{0\}$--bundle over $X$.  Its quotient by the scaling $\C^\times$--action gives the third bundle, a $\CP^{n-1}$--bundle over $X$.  Additionally, the quotient map $\C^n \setminus \{0\} \to \CP^{n-1}$ is itself a $\C^\times$--bundle, and this induces the structure of a $\C^\times$--bundle on the quotient map $\xi \setminus \zeta \to \P(\xi)$.  Thinking of these as complex line bundles, they are classified by a map to $\CP^\infty$, which can itself be thought of as the last vertical fibration, fibering over a point.

Note that the map between these two last fibers is surjective on $E$--cohomology.  It follows that the Serre spectral sequence for the third vertical fibration is degenerate, since all the classes in the fiber must survive.\footnote{This is called the Leray--Hirsch theorem.}  We thus conclude that $E^* \P(\xi)$ is a free $E^*(X)$--module on the classes $\{1, x, x^2, \ldots, x^{n-1}\}$ spanning $E^* \CP^{n-1}$.  To understand the ring structure, we need only compute $x^{n-1} \cdot x$, which must be able to be written in terms of the classes which are lower in $x$--degree: \[x^n = c_1(\xi) x^{n-1} - c_2 x^{n-2} + \cdots + (-1)^{n-1} c_n(\xi)\] for some classes $c_i(\xi) \in E^* X$.  The description in the theorem statement follows.
\end{proof}

We have a pair of obvious corollaries:
\begin{corollary}
The map $E^* X \to E^* \P(\xi)$ is injective. \qed
\end{corollary}
\begin{corollary}
A line bundle canonically splits off of $\pi^*(\xi)$: consider the sub-bundle of vectors $(v, (\ell, x))$ such that $v$ lies along the line $\ell$. \qed
\end{corollary}

\noindent Combining these and iterating gives something much stronger:

\begin{corollary}[``The splitting principle'']
Associated to any $n$--dimensional complex vector bundle $\xi$ over a base $X$, there is a canonical map $i_\xi: Y_\xi \to X$ such that $i_\xi^*: E^* X \to E^* Y$ is injective and there is a canonical splitting into complex line bundles: \[i_\xi^*(\xi) \cong \bigoplus_{i=1}^n \L_i. \qed\]
\end{corollary}

This Corollary is extremely important.  Its essential contents is to say that any question about characteristic classes can be checked for sums of line bundles.  Specifically, because of the injectivity of $i_\xi^*$, any relationship among the characteristic classes deduced in $E^* Y$ must already be true in the ring $E^* X$.  The following theorem is a consequence of this principle:

\begin{theorem}
Let $\xi: X \to BU(n)$ classify a vector bundle $\xi$.  Then the coefficient $c_j$ in the polynomial $c(\xi)$ is selected by $\sigma_j$: \[c_j(\xi) = \xi^*(\sigma_j).\]
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
\todo{This should follow from considering the map $BU(1)^{\times n} \to BU(n)$.}
\end{proof}

We now turn to algebraic geometry.  Our original calculation of $E^* BU(n)$ in \Cref{ECohomologyOfBUn} showed us that any map $\xi: X \to BU(n)$ classifying a rank $n$ complex vector bundle produces a sequence of $n$ distinct $E$--cohomology classes $\xi^*(\sigma_j) \in E^*(X)$.  \Cref{CohomologyOfProjectivization} showed us what these classes were good for: the belong to the coefficients of a monic polynomial used in a quotient construction.  Recalling that the algebro-geometric name for ring quotients is ``closed subschemes'', we re-interpret \Cref{CohomologyOfProjectivization} as follows:
\begin{corollary}[{\Cref{CohomologyOfProjectivization} redux}]
The map \[P(\xi)_E \to X_E \times \CP^\infty_E\] is a closed inclusion of $X_E$--schemes.  In fact, $P(\xi)_E$ is a divisor on $\CP^\infty_E$. \qed
\end{corollary}

We would like to package this information in terms of the classifying map $\xi_E: X_E \to BU(n)_E$.
\begin{theorem}\todo{Proposition 8.31 in FSFG shows that the isomorphism $BU(n)_E \cong \Div_n^+ \CP^\infty_E$ is independent of coordinate. Read it.}
For a complex orientable cohomology theory $E$, there is an isomorphism \[BU(n)_E \cong \Div_n^+ \CP^\infty_E,\] so that maps $\xi: X \to BU(n)$ are transported to divisors $\P(\xi)_E \subseteq \CP^\infty_E \times X_E$.  Selecting a particular complex orientation of $E$ begets two isomorphisms
\begin{align*}
BU(n)_E & \cong \A^n, &
\Div_n^+ \CP^\infty_E & \cong \A^n,
\end{align*}
and these are compatible with the centered isomorphism above. \qed
\end{theorem}

What's most remarkable about the description in this theorem is its coherence with topological facts we know about $BU(n)$.  The theorem follows from the projectivization construction, but there are natural operations on both sides of the isomorphism that continue to match up.  For instance, the Whitney sum map $BU(n) \times BU(m) \to BU(n+m)$ has the following behavior:

\begin{lemma}\label{WhitneySumOfDivisors}
The sum map \[BU(n) \times BU(m) \xrightarrow\oplus BU(n+m)\] induces on Chern polynomials the identity \[c(\xi \oplus \zeta) = c(\xi) \cdot c(\zeta).\]  In terms of divisors, \[\P(\xi \oplus \zeta)_E = \P(\xi)_E \sqcup \P(\zeta)_E,\] and hence there is an induced square
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
BU(n)_E \times BU(m)_E \arrow{r}{\oplus} \arrow[-,double]{d} & BU(n+m) \arrow[-,double]{d} \\
\Div_n^+ \CP^\infty_E \times \Div_m^+ \CP^\infty_E \arrow{r}{\sqcup} & \Div_{n+m}^+ \CP^\infty_E. \qed
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
\end{lemma}

The following is a consequence of combining this Lemma with the splitting principle:

\begin{corollary}
The map $Y_E \xrightarrow{f_\xi} X_E$ pulls $\P(\xi)_E$ back to give \[Y_E \times_{X_E} \P(\xi)_E \cong \bigoplus_{i=1}^n \left\{ c_1(\L_i) \right\}. \qed\]
\end{corollary}

\noindent This is to say that the splitting principle is a topological reflection (or, better, a topological enhancement) of the claim that a divisor base-changed to a separably closed field will split as a sum of points.

Thinking back to yesterday, we can also use \Cref{WhitneySumOfDivisors} to produce the stable divisor schemes.  Namely, the classifying space of the stable unitary group $BU$ arises as the colimit \[\cdots \to BU(n) \xrightarrow{\id \times 0} BU(n) \times BU(1) \xrightarrow{\oplus} BU(n+1) \to \cdots.\]  Applying the functor $(-)_E$ to this diagram yields one of the systems in \Cref{StableDivisorSchemeDefn}:

\begin{theorem}
There is a natural isomorphism $BU_E \cong \Div_0 \CP^\infty_E$. \qed
\end{theorem}

\begin{corollary}
There is a natural isomorphism $(BU \times \Z)_E \cong \Div \CP^\infty_E$. \qed
\end{corollary}

\begin{corollary}
$(BU \times \Z)_E$ is the free formal group on the curve $\CP^\infty_E$. \qed
\end{corollary}

Finally, we can also consider the tensoring structure maps \[\otimes: BU(n) \times BU(m) \to BU(nm).\]  In the case $n = m = 1$, this is the map \[\CP^\infty \times \CP^\infty \to \CP^\infty\] classifying the tensor product of line bundles that we've been using to imbue $\CP^\infty_E$ with the structure of a formal group.  In fact, there is a natural map \[\Div_n^+ \CP^\infty_E \times \Div_m^+ \CP^\infty_E \xrightarrow{\cdot} \Div_{nm}^+ \CP^\infty_E\] which extends this, given by the formula: \[(D_1 \subseteq \CP^\infty_E, D_2 \subseteq \CP^\infty_E) \mapsto (D_1 \times D_2 \subseteq \CP^\infty_E \times \CP^\infty_E \xrightarrow{\mu} \CP^\infty_E).\]
\begin{lemma}
There is a commutative diagram
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
BU(n)_E \times BU(m)_E \arrow{r}{\otimes} \arrow[-,double]{d} & BU(nm)_E \arrow[-,double]{d} \\
\Div_n^+ \CP^\infty_E \times \Div_m^+ \CP^\infty_E \arrow{r}{\cdot} & \Div_{nm}^+ \CP^\infty_E.
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
By the splitting principle, it is enough to check this on sums of line bundles.  A sum of line bundles corresponds to a totally decomposed divisor, and on a pair of such divisors $\bigsqcup_{i=1}^n [a_i]$ and $\bigsqcup_{j=1}^m [b_j]$, the map acts by \[\left(\bigsqcup_{i=1}^n [a_i] \right) \left( \bigsqcup_{j=1}^m [b_j] \right) = \bigsqcup_{i, j} [\mu_{\CP^\infty_E}(a_i, b_j)]. \qedhere\]
\end{proof}

\todo{Say that the top Chern class is the Euler class.}








\section{Feb 17: Operations and a model for cobordism}

Our eventual goal, like last time, is to give an algebro-geometric description of $MU_*(*)$ and of the cooperations $MU_* MU$.  There is such a description that passes through the Adams spectral sequence, also like last time, but $MU_*(*)$ is an integral algebra and so we cannot make do with working out the mod--$2$ Adams spectral sequence.  We would have to at least work out the mod--$p$ Adams spectral sequence for every $p$, but there is the following unfortunate theorem:
\begin{theorem}
There is an isomorphism
\[H\F_pP_0 H\F_pP \cong \F_p[\xi_0^\pm, \xi_1, \xi_2, \ldots] \otimes \Lambda[\tau_0, \tau_1, \ldots]\]
with $|\xi_j| = 2p^j-2$ and $|\tau_j| = 2p^j - 1$. \qed
\end{theorem}
\noindent Because we are no longer working in characteristic $2$ and because there are odd--dimensional classes in this algebra, we see that the dual mod--$p$ Steenrod algebra is \emph{graded-commutative}.  This is the first time we have encountered Hindrance \#\ref{SkewCommutativeDeficiency} from \Cref{TheSteenrodAlgebraSection} in the wild, and for now we will simply avoid these methods and find another approach.

There is such an alternative proof, due to Quillen, that bypasses the Adams spectral sequence.  This approach has some deficiencies of its own: it requires studying the algebra of operations $MU^* MU$, which we do not expect to be at all commutative, and it requires studying \textit{power operations}, which are in general very technical creatures.  However, we will eventually want to talk about power operations anyway, and because this is the road less traveled we will elect to take it.  Our job today is to define these two kinds of cohomology operations, as well as revisit the model of complex cobordism Quillen uses.

The description of the first class of operations follows immediately from our discussion of complex cobordism up to this point, so we will begin there.  We learned last time that for any complex-orientable cohomology theory $E$ we have the calculation \[E^* BU \cong E^*\llbracket \sigma_1, \sigma_2, \ldots, \sigma_j, \ldots\rrbracket,\] and we gave a rich interpretation of this in terms of divisor schemes: \[BU_E \cong \Div_0 \CP^\infty_E.\]  Two lectures ago, we learned that the stable divisor scheme has a universal property: it is the free formal group on the formal curve $\CP^\infty_E$.  Another avatar of this same fact is a description of the \emph{homology ring}, using the maps \[E_* BU(n) \otimes E_* BU(m) \to E_* BU(n+m)\] to induce a multiplicative structure on $E_* BU$:
\begin{corollary}
Let $E$ be a complex-orientable cohomology theory. Then: \[E_* BU \cong \Sym_{E_*} \widetilde E_* \CP^\infty.\]  A specific complex orientation of $E$ begets \[E_* \CP^\infty = E_*\{\beta_0, \beta_1, \ldots, \beta_n, \ldots\}\] and hence \[E_* BU = \Sym_{E_*} E_*\{\beta_1, \beta_2, \ldots\} = E_*[b_1, b_2, \ldots]. \qed\]
\end{corollary} \oweproof{Free formal schemes agree with symmetric Hopf algebras on comodules}

Thomifying these ``$\oplus$'' maps gives maps \[E_* MU(n) \otimes E_* MU(m) \to E_* MU(n+m),\] and the naturality of the $E$--Thom isomorphism produces an additional corollary:
\begin{corollary}
The Thom isomorphism $E_* BU \cong E_* MU$ respects both the $E_*$--module structure and the ring structure.  Hence, \[E_* MU \cong E_*[c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_n, \ldots],\] where $c_j$ is the image of $b_j$ under the Thom map. \qed
\end{corollary}

\todo{A corollary of the splitting principle is supposed to be that a Thom isomorphism for $\CP^\infty$ begets Thom isomorphisms for everything, and hence a ring spectrum map $MU \to E$.  We should produce that corollary now.  This is Lemma II.4.6 in Adams's blue book.}

\noindent This compact description of $E_* MU$ as an algebra will be useful to us later, but right now we are interested in $E^* MU$ and especially in $MU^* MU$.  The former is \emph{not} a ring, and although the latter is a ring its multiplication is exceedingly complicated.  Instead, we will content ourselves with an $E_*$--module basis:
\begin{definition}
Let $\alpha = (\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_n, \ldots)$ denote a multi-index where every entry is nonnegative and almost every entry is zero, and let $c_\alpha$ denote the corresponding monomial \[c_\alpha = \prod_{j=1}^\infty c_j^{\alpha_j}.\]  Additionally, we let $s_\alpha \in E^* MU$ denote the image of $c_\alpha$ under the Thom isomorphism.  It is called the \textit{$\alpha${\th} Landweber--Novikov operation}.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}\citeme{I.5.1 in Adams's blue book}
Let $E = MU$.  The Landweber--Novikov operations are the \emph{stable} operations acting on $MU$--cohomology, analogous to the Steenrod operations we started the semester talking about.  They satisfy the following properties:
\begin{itemize}
\item $s_0$ is the identity.
\item $s_\alpha$ is natural: $s_\alpha(f^* x) = f^*(s_\alpha x)$.
\item $s_\alpha$ is stable: $s_\alpha(\sigma x) = \sigma(s_\alpha x)$.
\item $s_\alpha$ is additive: $s_\alpha(x + y) = s_\alpha(x) + s_\alpha(y)$.
\item $s_\alpha$ satisfies a Cartan formula.  Define \[s_{\t}(x) = \sum_\alpha s_\alpha(x) \cdot t_1^{\alpha_1} t_2^{\alpha_2} \cdots t_n^{\alpha_n} \cdots =: \sum_{\alpha} s_\alpha(x) \t^\alpha\] for an infinite sequence of indeterminates $t_1$, $t_2$, \ldots.  Then: \[s_{\t}(x y) = s_{\t}(x) \cdot s_{\t}(y).\]
\item Let $\xi: X \to BU(n)$ classify a vector bundle and let $\phi$ denote the Thom isomorphism \[\phi: MU^* X \to MU^* T(\xi).\]  Then the Chern classes of $\xi$ are related to the Landweber--Novikov operations on the Thom spectrum by the formula \[\sum_\alpha \phi c_\alpha(\xi) \t^\alpha = \sum_\alpha s_\alpha \phi(1) \t^\alpha.\]
\end{itemize}
\end{remark}

We now turn to the construction of the power operations.  Power operations get their name from their \emph{multiplicative} properties, and correspondingly we do not (\textit{a priori}) expect them to be additive operations, so they are quite distinct from the Landweber--Novikov operations produced above.  Power operations arise from ``$E_\infty$'' structures on ring spectra\footnote{Or, by some accounts, ``$H_\infty$'' structures.}, but most such structures arise in nature from geometric models of cohomology theories.  To produce them for complex cobordism, we will use a particular model, alluded to in \Cref{IntroductionSection}.

\begin{definition}
Let $f: Y \to X$ be a map of manifolds.  A \textit{complex-orientation on the map $f$} is the data of a factorization
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
 & E \arrow{d} \\
Y \arrow{r}{f} \arrow[densely dotted]{ru}{i} & X
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
through a complex vector bundle $E$ on $X$ such that $i$ is an embedding and its normal bundle $\nu_i$ has a complex structure.\todo{Account for the odd-dimensional case and the dimension-jumping case.}  Two such factorizations are \textit{equivalent} when they appear as subbundles of a larger bundle and the embeddings are isotopic, compatibly with the structures on their normal bundles.
\end{definition}
\begin{lemma}
For $\dim E \gg 0$, this equivalence class is unique, if it exists. \qed
\end{lemma}
\begin{definition}
Two complex-oriented maps $f_0: Y_0 \to X$ and $f_1: Y_1 \to X$ are called \textit{cobordant} when there is a complex-oriented map $W \to X \times \R$ and elements $b_0, b_1 \in \R$ such that
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
Y_0 \arrow{r} \arrow{d} & X \times \{b_0\} \arrow{d} & Y_1 \arrow{r} \arrow{d} & X \times \{b_1\} \arrow{d} \\
W \arrow{r} & X \times \R & W \arrow{r} & X \times \R
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
become pull-back squares of complex-oriented maps of manifolds.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Thom]
For a manifold $X$, $MU^{-q}(X)$ is canonically isomorphic to the cobordism classes of complex-oriented maps of dimension $q$. \qed
\end{theorem}

\begin{remark}
This model has a variety of nice features.  For instance, its two variances are visible from the construction: a map $g: X' \to X$ induces a map $g^*: MU^* X \to MU^* X'$ by selecting a class $f: Y \to X$, perturbing $g$ so that it is transverse to $f$, and taking the pullback
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
Y \times_X X' \arrow{r} \arrow{d} & Y \arrow{d} \\
X' \arrow{r} & X.
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
But, also, if $g$ is additionally proper and complex-orientable, then it induces a map $g_*: MU^q X' \to MU^{q-d} X$, where $d$ is the dimension of $g$.  This is simply by postcomposition: a representative $f': Y' \to X'$ begets a new representative $g_* f' = g \circ f'$.\todo{Give this a name: Gysin, pushforward, shriek, \ldots}
\end{remark}

In fact, these push and pull maps are related by a formula:
\begin{lemma}\label{PushPullFormulaForMU}
Consider a Cartesian square of manifolds
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
Y \times_X Z \arrow{r}{g'} \arrow{d}{f'} & Z \arrow{d}{f} \\
Y \arrow{r}{g} & X,
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
where $g$ is transversal to $f$, $f$ is proper and complex-oriented, and $f'$ is endowed with the pull-back of the complex orientation of $f$. Then \[g^* f_* = f'_* (g')^*: h(Z) \to h(Y). \qed\]
\end{lemma}


We are now in a position to describe our power operations.
\begin{definition}\label{DefnPowerOperationForMU}
Consider a class in $U^{-2q}(X)$ represented by a proper complex-oriented map $f \co Y \to X$.  Its $n$--fold Cartesian product determines a class $f^{\times n} \co Y^{\times n} \to X^{\times n}$, and taking the homotopy quotient by a group $G$ acting on $\{1, \ldots, n\}$ gives a class \[Y^{\times n} \to X^{\times n} \to EG \times_G X^{\times n}\] and hence an \textit{external power operation} \[P^{\mathrm{ext}} \co MU^{-2q}(X) \to MU^{-2qn}(EG \times_G X^{\times n}).\]  Pulling back along the diagonal $\Delta: X \to X^{\times n}$ gives the the \textit{internal power operation} \[P \co MU^{-2q}(X) \to MU^{-2qn}(BG \times X).\]  Its action on the class represented by a proper complex-oriented even-dimensional map $f: Z \to X$ can also be written as \[P(f_* 1) = \Delta^* f^{\times n}_{hG}{}_* 1.\]
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
It's apparent that we've really needed this geometric model to accomplish this construction: we needed to understand how to take Cartesian powers of maps in a way that inherited a $G$--action.  This is not data that a ring spectrum is naturally equipped with, and if we were to tease out exactly what extra information we need to encode this operation, we would eventually arrive at the notion of an $E_\infty$--ring spectrum.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
A picky reader will (rightly) point out that $BG$ is not a manifold, and so we shouldn't be mixing it with out geometric model for $MU$.  This is a fair point, but since $BG$ can be approximated through any cellular dimension by a manifold, we won't worry about it.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
The chain model for ordinary homology is actually rigid enough to define power operations there, too.  Curiously, they are all generated by the quadratic power operations (i.e., the ``squares''), and all the quadratic power operations turn out to be \emph{additive} --- that is, you just get the Steenrod squares again!  This appears to be a curious degeneracy, but over the coming days we will exploit something similar with a very particular power operation in complex cobordism.
\end{remark}

\todo{Can we name some of the formal properties of power operations? Multiplicativity, say?}








\section{Feb 19: Quillen's theorem}

Our goal today is to apply a version of \Cref{PushPullFormulaForMU} to the push-pull definition of the power operation for $MU$ given in \Cref{DefnPowerOperationForMU}.  The relevant Cartesian square in that case has the form
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
W \arrow{r} \arrow{d}{g} & EG \times_G \arrow{d}{f^{\times k}_{hG}} \\
BG \times X \arrow{r}{\Delta} & EG \times_G X^{\times k}.
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
However, since the vertical map $f^{\times k}_{hG}$ is not an inclusion, we can't rely on \todo{Wait, why can't we just use \Cref{PushPullFormulaForMU}?}  So, we investigate the following slightly more general situation.

\begin{definition}
Let $X$ be a manifold.  Two closed submanifolds $Y$ and $Z$ are said to \textit{intersect cleanly} when $W = Y \cap Z$ is a submanifold and for each $w \in W$, the tangent space of $W$ at $w$ is given by $T_w W = T_w Y \cap T_w X$.  In this case, we draw a Cartesian square
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
W \arrow{r}{j'} \arrow{d}{i'} & Z \arrow{d}{i} \\
Y \arrow{r}{j} & X.
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
The \textit{excess bundle} of the intersection, $F$, is defined by the exact sequence
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
& & (i')^* TY \arrow{rd} \\
0 \arrow{r} & \nu_{i'} \arrow{rr} \arrow{ru} & & (j')^* \nu_i \arrow{r} & F \arrow{r} & 0.
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
$Y$ and $Z$ intersect transversally exactly when $F = 0$.
\end{remark}

\begin{lemma}\label{CleanIntersectionFormula}\citeme{Proposition 3.3 of Quillen}\needproof{Euler classes}
Suppose that $\nu_{i'}$, $\nu_i$, and $F$ are endowed with complex structures compatible with this exact sequence. For $z \in MU^*(Z)$, \[j^* i_* z = i'_*(e(F) \cdot (j')^* z)\] in $MU^{*+a}(Y, Y \setminus W)$, where $a = \dim \nu_i$. \qed \todo{The proof of this is easy, but not very relevant to formal geometry. Let's skip it and give a reference.}
\end{lemma}

Now let $G$ be a finite group and let $i: Z \to X$ be an embedding of $G$--manifolds. Then the $G$--fixed submanifold $X^G$ and $Z$ intersect cleanly in the diagram
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
Z^G \arrow{r}{r_Z} \arrow{d}{i^G} & Z \arrow{d}{i} \\
X^G \arrow{r}{r_X} & X.
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
Since $r_Z^*(\nu_i)$ is a $G$--bundle over a trivial $G$ space, there is a decomposition $r_Z^*(\nu_i) = \nu_{i^G} \oplus \mu_i$, where $\nu_{i^G}$ has no $G$--action and $\mu_i = F$, the excess bundle, carries all of the nontrivial $G$--action.  Applying $EG \times_G (-)$ to the diagram and picking $z \in MU^*(EG \times_G Z)$, \Cref{CleanIntersectionFormula} then gives \[r_X^* i_* z = i^G_*(e(\mu_i) \cdot r_Z^* z) \in MU^*(BG \times X^G, (BG \times X^G) \setminus (BG \times Z^G)).\]  Replacing the embedding condition with orientability, this gives the following:

\begin{lemma}\label{ProperCOIntersectionFormula}\citeme{Proposition 3.8 of Quillen}
Let $f: Z \to X$ be a proper complex-oriented $G$-map, represented by a factorization \[Z \xrightarrow i E \xrightarrow p X.\]  Let $\mu(E)$ be excess summand of $r_X^* E$ corresponding to the part of $E$ on which $G$ acts nontrivially, where, as before, $r_X$ is the inclusion of the fixpoint submanifold $X^G \subseteq X$.  Then, for $z \in MU^*(EG \times_G Z)$, we have: \[e(\mu(E)) \cdot r_X^* f_* z = f^G_*(e(\mu_i) \cdot r_Z^* z) \in MU^*(BG \times X^G). \qed\]
\end{lemma}

We are now in a position to apply \Cref{ProperCOIntersectionFormula} to our power operation square.

\begin{lemma}\label{PowerOpAndEulerClasses}\citeme{Proposition 3.12 of Quillen}
Suppose $G$ acts transitively on $\{1, \ldots, k\}$ and let $\rho$ denote the induced reduced regular $G$-representation. Suppose that $f: Z \to X$ is a proper complex-oriented map of dimension $2q$ and that $m$ is an integer larger than the dimension of $Z$, so that $m \eps + \nu_f$ is a vector bundle over $Z$, well-defined up to isomorphism, where $\eps$ is the trivial complex line bundle. Then \[e(\rho)^m P(f_* 1) = f_* e(\rho \otimes (m \eps + \nu_f)) \in MU^{2m(k-1)-2qk}(BG \times X).\]
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
We can take $m$ large enough that the complex-orientation on $f$ can be represented by a factorization \[Z \xrightarrow i m \eps \xrightarrow p X,\] and consider its $k${\th} power \[Z^{\times k} \xrightarrow{i^{\times k}} (m \eps)^{\times k} \xrightarrow{p^{\times k}} X^{\times k}.\]  We calculate the excess bundles to be
\begin{align*}
\mu_{i^{\times k}} & = \rho \otimes \nu_i, &
\mu((m \eps)^{\times k}) & = \rho \otimes m \eps.
\end{align*}
Since $G$ acts transitively, $\Delta: X \to X^{\times k}$ represents the inclusion of the $G$--fixed points.  Packaging all this into \Cref{ProperCOIntersectionFormula} gives \[e(\rho \otimes m\epsilon) \cdot \Delta^* f^{\times k}_{hG}{}_*(1) = f_*(e(\rho \otimes \nu_i) \cdot r_{W \to Z^{\times k}}^*(1)).\]
We then investigate each part separately:
\begin{align*}
e(\rho \otimes m\eps) & = e(\rho^{\oplus m}) = e(\rho)^m, &
\Delta^* f^{\times k}_{hG} {}_*(1) & = P(f_* 1), \\
e(\rho \otimes \nu_i) & = e(\rho \otimes (m \eps + \nu_f)), &
r^*_{W \to Z^{\times k}}(1) & = 1
\end{align*}
from which the claim follows.
\end{proof}

The utility of this theorem comes from our ability to compute just a little bit about the Euler classes involved in its statement.
\begin{corollary}\citeme{Quillen Prop 3.17}
\todo{Should we use $a_\alpha(v)$ as the notation?} \todo{In previous sections, you've been using $\xi$ to denote arbitrary vector bundles, not $E$.}Specialize to $G = C_k$, and let $\eta$ denote the line bundle on $BG$ owing to the inclusion $C_k \subseteq U(1)$.  Set $e(\eta) = v$ and $e(\rho) = w$.  Then, the Steenrod operation and Landweber operations are related by the formula \[w^{r+q} P x = \sum_{|\alpha| \le r} w^{r - |\alpha|} a(v)^\alpha s_\alpha(x)\] for $x \in MU^{-2q}(X)$ and $r$ is any integer sufficiently large with respect to $\dim X$ and $q$, where $a_j(T)$ are power series with coefficients in the subring $C$ generated by the tautological formal group law on $MU^*(*)$.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
The bundle $\rho$ splits as $\bigoplus_{i=1}^{k-1} \eta^{\otimes i}$.  Then, if $\L$ is any other line bundle with a trivial $G$--action,
\begin{align*}
e(\rho \otimes \L) & = e \left( \bigoplus_{i=1}^{k-1} \eta^i \otimes \L \right) = \prod_{i=1}^{k-1} e(\eta^i \otimes \L) \\
& = \prod_{i=1}^{k-1} F([i]_F(v), e(\L)) = w + \sum_{j=1}^\infty a_j(v) e(\L)^j,
\end{align*}
where \[w = e(\rho) = (k-1)! v^{k-1} + \sum_{j \ge k} b_j v^j\] for $b_j \in C$.  In general, the splitting principle shows that $e(\rho \otimes E)$ has \[e(\rho \otimes E) = \sum_{|\alpha| \le r} w^{r-|\alpha|} a(v)^\alpha c_\alpha(E).\]  Setting $E = m \eps + \nu_f$, we calculate $r = \dim(m \eps + \nu_f) = m - q$.  Inserting this into \Cref{PowerOpAndEulerClasses} then gives
\begin{align*}
w^m P(f_* 1) & = f_* \left( \sum_{|\alpha| \le r} w^{r - |\alpha|} a(v)^\alpha c_\alpha(m \eps + \nu_f) \right) \\
w^{r+q} P(f_* 1) & = \sum_{|\alpha| \le r} w^{r - |\alpha|} a(v)^\alpha f_* c_\alpha(m \eps + \nu_f) \\
& = \sum_{|\alpha| \le r} w^{r - |\alpha|} a(v)^\alpha s_\alpha(f_* 1). \qedhere
\end{align*}
\todo{Check that this last line is right. Can you pull Gysin maps past Euler classes?  What happened to $m \eps$? --- are you using the definition of Landweber--Novikov operations for $\nu_i$ instead of $\nu_f$?  Why?}
\end{proof}



\begin{theorem}\citeme{Quillen Theorem 5.1}
If $X$ is the homotopy type of a finite complex, then
\begin{align*}
MU^*(X) & = C \cdot \sum_{q \ge 0} MU^q(X), \\
\widetilde{MU}^*(X) & = C \cdot \sum_{q > 0} MU^q(X).
\end{align*}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
We can focus on \[\widetilde{MU}^{2*}(X) = C \cdot \sum_{q > 0} MU^{2q}(X) =: R^{2*},\] since $MU^{2*+1}(*) = 0$ and $\widetilde{MU}^{2*+1}(X)$ can be handled by suspending $X$ once, and then the unreduced case follows directly.  We will show this by inducting on the value of ``$*$'': suppose that \[R^{-2j}_{(p)} = \widetilde{MU}^{-2j}(X)_{(p)}\] for $j < q$ and consider $x \in \widetilde{MU}^{-2q}(X)$.  Then, for $n \gg 0$, we have \[w^{n+q} P x = \sum_{|\alpha| \le n} w^{n - |\alpha|} a(v)^\alpha s_\alpha x.\]  Recall that $w$ is a power series in $v$ with coefficients in $C$ and leading term $(p-1)! v^{p-1}$, so that $v^{p-1} = w \cdot \theta(v)$ for some invertible series $\theta$ with coefficients in $C$.  Since $s_\alpha$ lowers degree, we have $s_\alpha x \in R$ by the inductive hypothesis, so \[v^m(w^qPx - x) = \psi_x(v)\] for $\psi_x(T) \in R_{(p)}\llbracket T \rrbracket$.

Suppose $m \ge 1$ is the least integer for which we can write such an equation.  Applying the inclusion $i: X \to X \times B\Z/p$ to this equation sets $v = 0$ and yields $\psi(0) = 0$, hence $\psi_x(T) = T \omega_x(T)$ and \[v (v^{m-1}(w^qPx - x) - \omega_x(v)) = 0.\]  Since $v$ annihilates this equation, we can use the Gysin sequence associated to the spherical bundle \[S^1 \to B\Z/p \to \CP^\infty\] to produce a class $y \in \widetilde{MU}^{2(m-1)-2q}(X)$ with \[v^{m-1}(w^q P x - x) = \psi_1(x) + y \<p\>(v).\]  If $m > 1$, then $y \in R$ for degree reasons and hence the right-hand side gives an equation contradicting our minimality hypothesis.  So, $m = 1$, and the outer factor of $v^{m-1}$ is not present.  Restricting along $i$ again, we obtain the equation \[\left. \begin{array}{rr} -x & \text{if $q > 0$} \\ x^p - x & \text{if $q = 0$} \end{array} \right\} = \psi_1(0) + py.\]

In the first case, where $q > 0$, it follows that $MU^{-2q}(X) \subseteq R^{-2q} + pMU^{-2q}(X)$, and since $MU^{-2q}(X)$ has finite order torsion, it follows that $MU^{-2q}(X) = R^{-2q}$.  In the other case, $x \mapsto x^p - x$ kills $\widetilde{MU}^0(X)/(R^0 + p\widetilde{MU}^0(X))$.  But the ideal $\widetilde{MU}^0(X)$ is nilpotent, so $x \mapsto x^p$ is a nilpotent endomorphism of $\widetilde{MU}^0(X) / p\widetilde{MU}^0(X)$.  So, it follows that $\widetilde{MU}^0(X) = R^0$, and induction proves the theorem.\todo{I feel I don't understand the algebra in this second case.}
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}\label{QuillenSurjective}
The map $Laz \to MU^*$ is surjective. \qed
\end{corollary}

This is motivation enough for us to investigate the moduli of formal groups.  We will soon strengthen \Cref{QuillenSurjective} to show that this map is an isomorphism.

\todo[inline]{There's buzz about a ``Frobenius map'' for structured rings going around these days. I guess the point is that an $E_2$--algebra structure is enough to get a multiplicative map $E^0 X \to E^0 X \otimes E^0 BC_p$. This isn't additive, so it can't come from an infinite loop map, but it becomes additive when passing to the Tate construction: $E^X \to (E^X)^{tC_p}$, using the fact that the genuine $C_p$ fixed points of $E^{X^{\times p}}$ is $E^X$, and the square relating genuine, homotopy, and geometric fixed points.  Mike has been claiming that these results of Quillen's can be interpreted in this way, but I'm not sure what the interpretation is.  He says it has something to do with inverting the Euler class and the part of Quillen's argument that involves walking down the multiples of Euler classes on both sides of the equation.}

poincare duality for manifolds with oriented tangent bundle

wrong-way maps: $\zeta^* \zeta_* 1$ gives the Euler class of the bundle

Explicit Thom isomorphism map for universal cohomology: $\xi: X \to BU(n)$ Thomifies to $T(\xi) \to MU(n) \to MU$, representing a class $g \in MU^* T(\xi)$, and this gives a map
\begin{align*}
MU^*(X) & \to MU^* T(\xi) & \cong MU^*(E, E_0)\\
x & \mapsto & g \smile p^*(x),
\end{align*}
where $p: E \to X$ is the projection and $E_0$ is the image of the zero section.

The wrong--way maps come from conjugating by Poincar\'e duality: \[E^* X \cong E_{d_X-*} X \to E_{d_X-*} Y \cong E^*{*-d_X+d_Y} Y.\]  Poincar\'e duality comes from asserting that the stable normal bundle is oriented for the theory, and then Atiyah duality says \[D(X_+) \simeq \Susp^{-n} T(\nu) [\simeq T(\nu - n\eps) \simeq T(-\tau)]. \]

Q: Once you know that $MU$ has the universal formal group law on it, does the description of $MU_* MU$ follow immediately from evenness?  Probably?\todo{No, it follows from \emph{freeness}, and this should go into the operations/model section.}

-----

Need to talk about Gysin pushforwards in complex bordism and in ordinary cohomology.  Compare these with the theory of Thom isomorphism in general.  They're equivalent, right?  A complex orientation makes proper maps induce shriek maps, and shriek maps can be used to deduce what Chern classes are by push-pull: if $\zeta: X \to E$ is the zero section of a complex bundle $\xi$, then $e(\xi) = i^* i_*(1)$ I think.
