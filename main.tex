\title{Formal Geometry in Algebraic Topology}
\author{Eric Peterson}

\begin{document}

\maketitle

\textbf{Class information}

\vspace{2\baselineskip} \noindent \textit{Meeting times: }
Spring 2016, MWF 12pm--1pm.

\vspace{2\baselineskip} \noindent \textit{Goals: }
The primary goal of this class is to teach students to view results in algebraic topology through the lens of (formal) algebraic geometry.

\vspace{2\baselineskip} \noindent \textit{Grading: }
This class won't have any official assignments. I'll give references as readings for those who would like a deeper understanding, though I'll do my best to ensure that no extra reading is required to follow the arc of the class.

I do want to assemble course notes from this class, but it's unlikely that I will have time to type \emph{all} of them up. Instead, I would like to ``crowdsource'' this somewhat: I'll type up skeletal notes for each lecture, and then we as a class will try to flesh them out as the semester progresses. As incentive to help, those who contribute to the document will have their name included in the acknowledgements, and those who contribute \emph{substantially} will have their name added as a coauthor. Everyone could use more CV items.

\section{Jan 25}

The goal of this class is to communicate a certain \textit{weltanschauung} uncovered in pieces by many different people working in bordism theory, and the goal just for today is to tell a story about one theorem where it is especially apparent.

To begin, recall that a bordism theory $MX$, where $X$ is some suitable family of structure groups $X_n \to O(n)$, is a homology theory similar to singular homology but where the chains are constructed from $X$--structured manifolds and their boundaries.  The coefficient ring of $MX$, or its value $MX_*(*)$ on a point, gives the ring of $X$--bordism classes, and generally $MX_*(Y)$ of some space $Y$ gives a kind of ``bordism in families''.  There are evident comparison morphisms for the most ordinary kinds of bordism, given by replacing a chain of manifolds with an equivalent simplicial chain: \[MO \to H\Z/2, \quad MSO \to H\Z.\] The first one is essentially an equivalence, but the second one is quite far from being an equivalence. More intriguingly, for $X = e$ the trivial structure group, the Pontryagin--Thom construction gives an equivalence $Me \xrightarrow{\simeq} \S$, and so it is possible (and some people have indeed taken up this viewpoint) that stable homotopy theory can be done solely through the lens of ``framed bordism''.

I'm a stable homotopy theorist rather than a differential topologist, and so I prefer to view this the other way: the sphere spectrum $\S$ often appears in my life as a natural object, and I will sometimes replace it by $Me$, the framed bordism spectrum.  For example, often I encounter a ring spectrum $E$, and it comes equipped with a unit map $\S \to E$, which I can reconsider as a ring map $\S = Me \to E$.

This is the situation Ochanine and Witten found themselves in some decades ago. Ochanine had proven the following mysterious theorem:

\begin{theorem}[Ochanine]
There is a cobordism invariant $o(M)$ of an oriented manifold $M$ which is a level $2$ modular form. It is probably multiplicative: if $F \to E \to M$ is a suitable fibration, then $o(E) = o(F) \cdot o(M)$.
\end{theorem}

\noindent 




theories of integration




The structure of the class will be, more or less, to work through a sequence of case studies where this perspective on algebraic topology shines through most brightly.  We'll start by working through Thom's calculation of the homotopy of $MO$, which simultaneously holds the attractive features of being free of technical complexity while revealing essentially all of the structural complexity.  Having seen that through to the end, we'll then work on reinforcing our technical underpinnings, and then we'll venture on to other examples.






The stated goal of this class is to study something called the ``$\sigma$--orientation'', due in various incarnations to Ochanine, Witten, Ando--Hopkins--Strickland, Ando--Strickland, Ando--Hopkins--Rezk, and probably others.



\begin{theorem}[Witten]
Ochanine's genus is definitely multiplicative. Also, if $M$ is a Spin manifold such that twice the first Pontryagin class vanishes, then $o(M)$ can be refined to a level $1$ modular form $w(M)$.
\end{theorem}




\begin{theorem}[Ando--Hopkins--Strickland]
If $E$ is an ``elliptic cohomology theory'', then there is a canonical map $M\String \to E$ called the $\sigma$--orientation.  If $E$ is taken to be Tate $K$--theory $K^{\Tate}$, then the induced map $M\String_* \to K^{\Tate}_*$ is (the $q$--expansion of) Witten's genus.
\end{theorem}

A meta-goal of this class is to focus on how the homotopical $\sigma$--orientation was actually first constructed: using formal geometry.  Their original proof begins with a reduction to understanding maps \[MU[6, \infty) \to E\] and then working to show that they can complete the missing arrow in the diagram
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
MU[6, \infty) \arrow{r} \arrow{rd} & M\String \arrow[densely dotted]{d} \\
& E.
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
Leaving aside the extension problem for the moment, their main theorem is the following description of the cohomology ring $E^* MU[6, \infty)$:
\begin{theorem}[Ando--Hopkins--Strickland]
For $E$ an even--periodic cohomology theory, \[\Spec E_* MU[6, \infty) \cong C^3(\G_E; \sheaf I(0)),\] where ``$C^3(\G_E; \sheaf I(0))$'' is a certain scheme.  When $E$ is taken to be elliptic, this furnishes the scheme with a canonical point, and hence gives a preferred class $MU[6, \infty) \to E$.
\end{theorem}
\noindent Our real goal is to understand theorems like these. The class will be made up of case studies where we investigate some phenomenon in algebraic topology and recast its solution in terms of formal geometry. The overriding theme of the class will be that this is a good organizing principle that gives us one avenue of insight into how homotopy theory functions. 





Theories of integration

Framed bordism agrees with the sphere spectrum


\section{Material for lecture}

The cohomology of a qc sheaf pushed forward from a scheme to a stack along a cover agrees with just the cohomology over the scheme. (In the case of $* \to * \mmod G$, this probably uses the cospan $* \to * \mmod G \leftarrow *$ with pullback $G$...)

Akhil Mathew has notes from an algebraic geometry class ( https://math.berkeley.edu/{\textasciitilde}amathew/232b.pdf ) where lectures 3--5 address the theorem of the cube.

Equivalences of various sorts of cohomologies: Ext in modules and quasicoherent cohomology (goodness. Hartshorne, I suppose); Ext in comodules and quasicoherent cohomology on stacks (COCTALOS Lemma 12.4); quasicoherent cohomology on simplicial schemes (Stacks project 09VK).

\section{$\context{H\F_2}(MO)$}

Hood made the following nice observation. $MO^{H\F_2}$ is the scheme of coordinates on $\RP^\infty_{H\F_2}$, with coordinate ring $\F_2[x_1, x_2, \ldots]$ and corresponding series $f(t) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty x_{n-1} t^n$ and $x_0 = 1$ implicit. This identification is equivalent to Adams's observation that $MO$ is the ``free homotopy ring spectrum'' on $MO(1)$ his sense. Then, $\Spec \mathcal{A}_* = \underline{\operatorname{Aut}}(\widehat{\G}_a)$ acts on this by coordinate changes (and we can pick a left-- or right--action as we see fit). If we pick an action by postcomposition, then we can do the following nice thing: set $f(t) = f_2(t) + g(t)$, where $f_2(t)$ contains just the terms in degrees perfect powers of $2$. Then $f_2^{-1}(f(t))$ is another coordinate with no terms in degrees perfect powers of $2$, and any nontrivial automorphism applied to this ``reduced'' series will re-introduce terms in degrees perfect powers of $2$.  So, this is a canonical form for the series under the $\underline{\operatorname{Aut}}(\widehat{\mathbb G}_a)$--action which admits no further automorphisms. It should follow that $H^*(\context{H\F_2}; \context{H\F_2}(MO))$ has amplitude $0$ and takes the form $\F_2[x_j \mid j \ne 2^n - 1]$, i.e., whose generating function is arbitrary other than having no terms in degrees perfect powers of $2$.

This means that the Adams spectral sequence degenerates and this computes $\pi_* MO$.  (It would be nice to interpret this in terms of a logarithm on $\RP^\infty_{H\F_2}$.)  It also means that the Hurewicz map is injective, hence that $MO$ is a retract of $H\F_2 \sm MO$, hence that $MO$ is an $H\F_2$--module, hence that $MO$ is a wedge of shifts of $H\F_2$.
