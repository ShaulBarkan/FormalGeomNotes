\chapter*{Material for lecture}






Mike's 1995 announcement is a nice read. There are many snippets you could pull out of it for use here. ``$H\Q$ serves as the target for the Todd genus, but actually the Todd genus of a manifold is an integer and it turns out that $KU$ refines the Todd genus.''  The end of section 3, with $\tau \mapsto 1/\tau$, is mysterious.  In section 4, Mike claims that there's a $BU[6, \infty)$--structured splitting principle into sums of things of the form $(1 - \L_1)(1 - \L_2)(1 - \L_3)$.  He then says that one expects the characteristic series of a $BU[6, \infty)$--genus to be a series of $3$ variables, which is nice intuition.  Could mention that $\Theta^k$ is a kind of $k${\th} difference operator, so that things in the kernel of $\Theta^k$ are ``$k${\th} order polynomials''.  (More than this, the theorem of the cube is reasonable from this perspective, since $\Theta^3$ kills ``quadratic things'' and the topological object $H^2(-; \Z)$ classifying line bundles is indeed ``quadratic''.)  If the bundle admits a symmetry operation, then the fiber over $(x, y, -x-y)$ is canonically trivialized, so a $\Sigma$--structure on a symmetric line bundle is a $\Theta^3$--structure that restricts to the identity on these canonical parts.  Mike claims (Theorem 6.2) that if $1/2 \in E^0(*)$ or if $E$ is $K(n)$--local, $n \le 2$, then $B\String^E$ is the parameter space of $\Sigma$--structures on the sheaf of functions vanishing at the identity on $G_E$.  The map $M\String \to KO_{\Tate}$ actually factors through $M\Spin$, so even though this produces the right $q$--series, you really need to know that $M\String$ factors through $\tmf$ and $M\Spin$ \emph{doesn't} to deduce the modularity for $\String$--manifolds.  (You can prove modularity separately for $BU[6, infty)$--manifolds, though, by essentially the same technique: refer to the rest of the (complex!) moduli of elliptic curves, which exist as $MU[6, infty)$--spectra.)

Generally: if $X$ is a space, then $X_{H\F_2}$ is a scheme with an $\Aut \widehat \G_a$--action. If $X$ is a spectrum (so it fails to have a diagonal map) then $(H\F_2)_* X$ is just an $\F_2$--module, also with an $\Aut \widehat \G_a$--action.

The cohomology of a qc sheaf pushed forward from a scheme to a stack along a cover agrees with just the cohomology over the scheme. (In the case of $* \to * \mmod G$, this probably uses the cospan $* \to * \mmod G \leftarrow *$ with pullback $G$...)

Akhil Mathew has notes from an algebraic geometry class ( https://math.berkeley.edu/{\textasciitilde}amathew/232b.pdf ) where lectures 3--5 address the theorem of the cube.

Equivalences of various sorts of cohomologies: Ext in modules and quasicoherent cohomology (goodness. Hartshorne, I suppose); Ext in comodules and quasicoherent cohomology on stacks (COCTALOS Lemma 12.4); quasicoherent cohomology on simplicial schemes (Stacks project 09VK).

Make clear the distinction between $E_n$ and $\widehat{E(n)}$. Maybe explain the Devinatz--Hopkins remark that $r: \widehat{E(n)} \to E_n$ is an inclusion of fixed points and as such does not classify the versal formal group law.


when describing Quillen's model, he makes a lot of use of Gysin maps and Thom / Euler classes. at this point, maybe you can introduce what a Thom sheaf / Thom class is for a pointed formal curve?




\begin{theorem}\label{DetectingFormalVarieties}
\todo{I think this theorem is motivated by Artin--Mazur formal groups, and the Crystals notes use it to extract a formal group from a Dieudonn\'e module.  Some motivation could go here.}Let $A$ be a Noetherian ring and $G: \CatOf{AdicAlgebras}_A \to \CatOf{AbelianGroups}$ be a functor such that
\begin{enumerate}
\item $G(A) = 0$.
\item $G$ takes surjective maps to surjective maps.
\item There is a finite, free $A$--module $M$ and a functorial isomorphism \[I \otimes_A M \to G(B) \to G(B')\] whenever $I$ belongs to a square-zero extension of adic $A$--algebras \[I \to B \to B'.\]
\end{enumerate}
Then, $G \cong \A^n$ as a functor to sets, where $n = \dim M$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
This is 9.6.4 in the Crystals notes.
\end{proof}



$MUP$ happens to be the Thom spectrum of $BU \times \Z$.
