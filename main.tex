\title{Formal Geometry in Algebraic Topology}
\author{Eric Peterson}

\begin{document}

\maketitle

\textbf{Class information}

\vspace{2\baselineskip} \noindent \textit{Meeting times: }
Spring 2016, MWF 12pm--1pm.

\vspace{2\baselineskip} \noindent \textit{Goals: }
The primary goal of this class is to teach students to view results in algebraic topology through the lens of (formal) algebraic geometry.

\vspace{2\baselineskip} \noindent \textit{Grading: }
This class won't have any official assignments. I'll give references as readings for those who would like a deeper understanding, though I'll do my best to ensure that no extra reading is required to follow the arc of the class.

I do want to assemble course notes from this class, but it's unlikely that I will have time to type \emph{all} of them up. Instead, I would like to ``crowdsource'' this somewhat: I'll type up skeletal notes for each lecture, and then we as a class will try to flesh them out as the semester progresses. As incentive to help, those who contribute to the document will have their name included in the acknowledgements, and those who contribute \emph{substantially} will have their name added as a coauthor. Everyone could use more CV items.

Generally: if $X$ is a space, then $X_{H\F_2}$ is a scheme with an $\Aut \widehat \G_a$--action. If $X$ is a spectrum (so it fails to have a diagonal map) then $(H\F_2)_* X$ is just an $\F_2$--module, also with an $\Aut \widehat \G_a$--action.

The cohomology of a qc sheaf pushed forward from a scheme to a stack along a cover agrees with just the cohomology over the scheme. (In the case of $* \to * \mmod G$, this probably uses the cospan $* \to * \mmod G \leftarrow *$ with pullback $G$...)

Akhil Mathew has notes from an algebraic geometry class ( https://math.berkeley.edu/{\textasciitilde}amathew/232b.pdf ) where lectures 3--5 address the theorem of the cube.

Equivalences of various sorts of cohomologies: Ext in modules and quasicoherent cohomology (goodness. Hartshorne, I suppose); Ext in comodules and quasicoherent cohomology on stacks (COCTALOS Lemma 12.4); quasicoherent cohomology on simplicial schemes (Stacks project 09VK).

using the splitting principle to describe $\Div^+_n \CP^\infty_E = BU(n)_E$, and in particular that projectivization theorem. This is in the proof of 16.2 in Switzer, though he doesn't state it as one of the consequences in the theorem text itself. The main point is that the fiber map $\CP^{n-1} \to P(V) \to X$ postcomposes by $P(V) \to \CP^\infty$ to the skeletal inclusion, so the Serre spectral sequence degenerates since its fiber is unmolested (or: the Leray--Hirsch theorem). The Chern classes are \emph{defined} by the one remaining multiplicative extension.

character sheaves, $\moduli{fg}$ versus $\moduli{fg}^{(1)}$, graded versus ungraded things. this is explored in some detail around Remark 3.14 and formula (3.4) in Paul's notes on $\CatOf{QCoh}(\moduli{fg})$.

A proof of Quillen's theorem appears in II.8 in Adams's blue book. This actually looks like some of it is amenable to attack under the formal group theoretic perspective? Doing this ``right'' would be tricky: there are odd--dimensional phenomena, and the Bockstein actually matters. Still, a thought.

Make clear the distinction between $E_n$ and $\widehat{E(n)}$. Maybe explain the Devinatz--Hopkins remark that $r: \widehat{E(n)} \to E_n$ is an inclusion of fixed points and as such does not classify the versal formal group law.

Mike says that in unpublished AHS work they got at $MString^E$ using an equivalence $M\String \simeq MU[6, \infty) \sm_{\Susp^\infty_+ \Spin/SU} \S$ and a collapsing $\Tor$ spectral sequence.
