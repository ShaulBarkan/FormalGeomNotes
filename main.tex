This class won't have any official assignments. I'll give references as readings for those who would like a deeper understanding, though I'll do my best to ensure that no extra reading is required to follow the arc of the class.

I do want to assemble course notes from this class, but it's unlikely that I will have time to type \emph{all} of them up. Instead, I would like to ``crowdsource'' this somewhat: I'll type up skeletal notes for each lecture, and then we as a class will try to flesh them out as the semester progresses.

\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Jan 25: Introduction}

The goal of this class is to communicate a certain \textit{weltanschauung} uncovered in pieces by many different people working in bordism theory, and the goal just for today is to tell a story about one theorem where it is especially apparent.

To begin, recall that a bordism theory $MX$, where $X$ is some suitable family of structure groups $X_n \to O(n)$, is a homology theory similar to singular homology but where the chains are constructed from $X$--structured manifolds and their boundaries.  The coefficient ring of $MX$, or its value $MX_*(*)$ on a point, gives the ring of $X$--bordism classes, and generally $MX_*(Y)$ of some space $Y$ gives a kind of ``bordism in families''.  There are evident comparison morphisms for the most ordinary kinds of bordism, given by replacing a chain of manifolds with an equivalent simplicial chain: \[MO \to H\Z/2, \quad MSO \to H\Z.\] In both cases, we can evaluate on a point to get ring maps $MO_*(*) \to \Z/2$ and $MSO_*(*) \to \Z$, called ``genera'' --- neither of which is very interesting, since they're both zero in positive degrees.\todo{A comparison of this with the usual spectrum definition of $MX$ appears in Switzer 12.35.}

However, having maps of homology theories (rather than just maps of coefficient rings) is considerably more data: we can extact from this a theory of integration.  Consider the following:
\begin{align*}
MSO_n K(\Z, n) & = \left\{ \text{oriented $n$--manifolds mapping to $K(\Z, n)$} \right\} / \sim \\
& = \left\{ \begin{array}{c}\text{oriented $n$--manifolds $M$} \\ \text{with a specified class $\omega \in H^n(M; \Z)$} \end{array}\right\} / \sim.
\end{align*}
The yoga of stable homotopy theory then allows us to build a composite \[\S^0 \xrightarrow{(M, \omega)} MSO \sm (\S^{-n} \sm \Susp^\infty_+ K(\Z, n)) \to MSO \sm H\Z \xrightarrow{\phi \sm 1} H\Z \sm H\Z \xrightarrow\mu H\Z,\] where $\phi$ is the orientation map, and this gives us an integer. This integer is $\int_M \omega$, and it comes equipped with a Stokes' theorem due to the relation ``$\sim$'', and we can begin to see what the techniques of stable homotopy theory have to offer.

Now take $X = e$ to be the trivial structure group, so that the Pontryagin--Thom construction gives an equivalence $Me \xrightarrow{\simeq} \S$.  It is thus possible (and some people have indeed taken up this viewpoint) that stable homotopy theory can be done solely through the lens of ``framed bordism''. I'm a stable homotopy theorist rather than a differential topologist, and so I prefer to view this the other way: the sphere spectrum $\S$ often appears in my life as a natural object, and I will sometimes replace it by $Me$, the framed bordism spectrum.  For example, often I encounter a ring spectrum $E$, and it comes equipped with a unit map $\S \to E$, which I can reconsider as a ring map $\S = Me \to E$.  Following along the lines of the previous paragraph, we learn that we can thus think of any ring spectrum $E$ as automatically equipped with a theory of integration for framed manifolds.

Sometimes, as in the examples above, this unit map factors: \[\S = Me \to MO \to H\Z/2.\]  This is a witness to the overdeterminacy of $H\Z/2$'s integral for framed bordism: if the framed manifold is pushed all the way down to an unoriented manifold, there is still enough residual data to define the integral.  For a generic ring spectrum $E$, we can ask the analogous question: for a Hausdorff filtration on $O$ by structure groups, what stage does the unit map $Me \to E$ factor through?  The map $SO \to O$ considered above is the beginning of the Postnikov filtration of $O$, and we include a diagram of this filtration and some interesting integration theories related to it:
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
Me \arrow{r} \arrow{rrd} \arrow{rrrd} \arrow{rrrrd} & \cdots \arrow{r} & M\Spin \arrow{r} \arrow[crossing over]{d} & MSO \arrow{r} \arrow[crossing over]{d} & MO \arrow[crossing over]{d} \\
& & ko & H\Z & H\Z/2.
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}

This is the situation homotopy theorists found themselves in some decades ago, in the wake of two important results of Ochanine and Witten. Ochanine had proven the following mysterious theorem using analytic techniques:

\begin{theorem}[Ochanine]
There is a cobordism invariant $o(M)$ of an oriented manifold $M$ which is a level $2$ modular form. It is somewhat multiplicative: if $F \to E \to M$ is an exceedingly nice fibration, then $o(E) = o(F) \cdot o(M)$.
\end{theorem}

\noindent Witten then strengthened this result considerably:

\begin{theorem}[Witten]
Ochanine's genus is in fact multiplicative. Also, if $M$ is a Spin manifold such that twice its first Pontryagin class vanishes, then $o(M)$ can be ``refined''\todo{What does ``refined'' mean, anyway? It's a square root, maybe?} to a level $1$ modular form $w(M)$.
\end{theorem}

\noindent However, neither party gave indication that their result should be valid ``in families'', and no theory of integration was produced.  It wasn't even clear what such a claim would mean: to give a topological enrichment of these theorems would mean finding a ring spectrum $E$ such that $E_*(*)$ had something to do with modular forms.  Around the same time, Landweber, Ravenel, and Stong began studying ``elliptic cohomology'' for independent reasons, and a decade later Ando, Hopkins, and Strickland put them together in the following theorem:

\begin{theorem}[Ando--Hopkins--Strickland]
If $E$ is an ``elliptic cohomology theory'', then there is a canonical map $M\String \to E$ called the $\sigma$--orientation.  Specializing to Tate $K$--theory $K^{\Tate}$, the induced map $M\String_* \to K^{\Tate}_*$ is Witten's genus.
\end{theorem}

We now come to the motivation for this class.  The homotopical $\sigma$--orientation was actually first constructed using formal geometry.  The original proof of Ando--Hopkins--Strickland begins with a reduction to understanding maps \[MU[6, \infty) \to E,\] and then they work to show that they can complete the missing arrow in the diagram
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
MU[6, \infty) \arrow{r} \arrow{rd} & M\String \arrow[densely dotted]{d} \\
& E.
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
Leaving aside the extension problem for the moment, their main theorem is the following description of the cohomology ring $E^* MU[6, \infty)$:
\begin{theorem}[Ando--Hopkins--Strickland]
For $E$ an even--periodic cohomology theory, \[\Spec E_* MU[6, \infty) \cong C^3(\G_E; \sheaf I(0)),\] where ``$C^3(\G_E; \sheaf I(0))$'' is a certain scheme.  When $E$ is taken to be elliptic, so that there is a specified isomorphism $\G_E \cong C^\wedge_0$ for $C$ an elliptic curve, this furnishes the scheme with a canonical point. Hence, there is a preferred class $MU[6, \infty) \to E$, natural in the choice of elliptic $E$.
\end{theorem}

\noindent Our real goal is to understand theorems like these.  The structure of the class will be, more or less, to work through a sequence of case studies where this perspective on algebraic topology shines through most brightly.  We'll start by working through Thom's calculation of the homotopy of $MO$, which simultaneously holds the attractive features of being free of technical complexity while revealing essentially all of the structural complexity.  Having seen that through to the end, we'll then work on reinforcing our technical underpinnings, and then we'll venture on to other examples.  The overriding theme of the class will be that this is a good organizing principle that gives us one avenue of insight into how homotopy theory functions.

\chapter{Unoriented bordism}


\section{Jan 27: Thom spectra and the Thom isomorphism}

Our first case study is a sequence of theorems about the unoriented bordism spectrum $MO$.  I wanted to begin by recalling one definition of the spectrum $MO$, since it will be useful to us throughout the semester.

\begin{definition}
For a spherical bundle $S^{n-1} \to \xi \to X$, its Thom space is given by the cofiber \[\xi \to X \xrightarrow{\text{cofiber}} T(\xi).\]
\end{definition}
\begin{proof}[``Proof'' of definition]
There's a more usual construction of the Thom space too: the associated disk bundle by gluing an $n$--disk in fiberwise, then taking the one--point compactification: \[T(\xi) = (\xi \sqcup'_{S^{n-1}} D^n)^+.\] How does this compare? Well, the thickening of $\xi$ is an $n$--disk bundle is the same thing as taking the mapping cylinder on $\xi \to X$. Since the inclusion into the mapping cylinder is now a cofibration, the quotient by this subspace agrees with both the cofiber of the map and the one--point compactification.
\end{proof}

Before proceeding, here are two important examples:
\begin{example}\label{TrivialBundleThomExample}
If $\xi = S^{n-1} \times X$ is the trivial bundle, then $T(\xi) = S^n \sm (X_+)$.  This is supposed to indicate what Thom spaces are ``doing'': if you feed in the trivial bundle then you get the suspension out, so if you feed in a twisted bundle you should think of it as a \textit{twisted suspension}.
\end{example}

\begin{example}\label{RPnThomExample}
Let $\xi$ be the tautological $S^0$--bundle over $\RP^\infty = BO(1)$.  Because $\xi$ has contractible total space, the cofiber degenerates and it follows that $T(\xi) = \RP^\infty$. More generally, arguing by cells shows that the Thom space for the tautological bundle over $\RP^n$ is $\RP^{n+1}$.
\end{example}

Now we catalog a bunch of useful properties of the Thom space functor. Firstly, recall that a spherical bundle over $X$ is the same data as a map $X \to B \GL_1 S^{n-1}$, where $\GL_1 S^{n-1}$ is the subspace of $F(S^{n-1}, S^{n-1})$ expressed by the pullback
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
\GL_1 S^{n-1} \arrow{r} \arrow{d} & F(S^{n-1}, S^{n-1}) \arrow{d} \\
\Aut_{h\CatOf{Spaces}} S^{n-1} \arrow{r} & \End_{h\CatOf{Spaces}} S^{n-1} \arrow[-,double]{r} & \pi_0 F(S^{n-1}, S^{n-1}).
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
We can interpret $T$ as a functor from the slice category over $BGL_1 S^{n-1}$ to $\CatOf{Spaces}$: maps \[Y \xrightarrow{f} X \xrightarrow{\xi} B \GL_1 S^{n-1}\] induce maps $T(f^* \xi) \to T(\xi)$, and $T$ is suitably homotopy-invariant.

Next, a common source of spherical bundles is taking the spherical subbundle of a vector bundle.  Since rank $n$ vector bundles are also classified by an object $BO(n)$, this begets a map $J_{\R}^n: BO(n) \to B \GL_1 S^{n-1}$ for each $n$.  Homotopy theorists are very interested in the block--inclusion maps $i^n: BO(n) \to BO(n+1)$ and the colimit $BO = BO(\infty)$.  The suspension functor induces a map $\GL_1 S^{n-1} \to \GL_1 S^n$, and we are led to ask about the compatibility of these operations.  As a route to answering this, the block--inclusion maps are a special case of a more general direct sum map $\oplus: BO(n) \times BO(m) \to BO(n+m)$, given by the precomposition \[BO(n) = BO(n) \times * \xrightarrow{\operatorname{id} \times \text{triv}} BO(n) \times BO(1) \xrightarrow\oplus BO(n+1).\] The spaces $B \GL_1 S^{n-1}$ enjoy a similar ``collective monoid'' structure, given by taking the fiberwise join two spherical bundles with a common base.
\begin{lemma}
The fiberwise join is represented by maps \[B\GL_1 S^{n-1} \times B\GL_1 S^{m-1} \to B\GL_1 S^{n+m-1},\] and these maps commute with the block sum maps on the $BO(n)$ family. \qed
\end{lemma}
\noindent Again taking a cue from $K$--theory, we take the colimit as $n$ grows large.
\begin{corollary}
There is a map of $H$--spaces $J_{\R}: BO \to B\GL_1 \S$ called the \textit{stable $J$--homomorphism}. \qed
\end{corollary}
\noindent Finally, we can ask about the compatibility of $T$ with all of this:
\begin{lemma}
$T$ is monoidal: it carries fiberwise joins to smash products of spaces. \qed
\end{lemma}

We are now prepared to define our spectrum $MO$.  The unstable $J$--maps $J_{\R}^n: BO(n) \to B\GL_1 S^{n-1}$ give Thom spaces $T(J_{\R}^n)$,\todo{Be careful about dimension here: you really mean a reduced tautological bundle, related to how $BO$ has only one connected component.} equipped with maps\todo{Fix this equation.} \[\Susp T(J_{\R}^n) = T(J_{\R}^n \oplus \text{triv}) \to T(J_{\R}^{n+1}).\] Setting $MO(n) = \Susp^{-n} \Susp^\infty T(J_{\R}^n)$, we again assemble this data into a single object: \[MO := \colim_n MO(n) = \colim_n \Susp^{-n} T(J_{\R}^n).\]

The spectrum $MO$ has several remarkable properties.  The most basic such property is that it is a ring spectrum, and this follows immediately from $J_{\R}$ being a homomorphism of $H$--spaces.  Much more excitingly, we can also deduce the presence of Thom isomorphisms just from the properties stated thus far.  That $J_{\R}$ is a homomorphism means that the following square commutes:
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
BO \times BO \arrow{r}{\sigma, \simeq} \arrow[bend right]{rrd} & BO \times BO \arrow{r}{\mu} \arrow{d}{J_{\R} \times J_{\R}} & BO \arrow{d}{J_{\R}} \\
& B\GL_1 \S \times B\GL_1 \S \arrow{r}{\mu} & B\GL_1 \S.
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
We have extended this square very slightly by a certain shearing map $\sigma$ defined by $\sigma(x, y) = (xy^{-1}, y)$.\todo{$\sigma$ \emph{almost} shows up in giving a categorical definition of a $G$--torsor.  I wish I understood this, but I always get tangled up.}  It's evident that $\sigma$ is a homotopy equivalence, since just as we can de-scale the first coordinate by $y$ we can re-scale by it.  We can calculate directly the behavior of the long composite: \[J_{\R} \circ \mu \circ \sigma(x, y) = J_{\R} \circ \mu(xy^{-1}, y) = J_{\R}(xy^{-1}y) = J_{\R}(x).\]  It follows that the second coordinate plays no role, and that the bundle classified by the long composite can be written as $J_{\R} \times 0$.\footnote{This factorization does \emph{not} commute with the rest of the diagram, just with the little triangle it forms.}  We are now in a position to see the Thom isomorphism:
\begin{lemma}[Thom isomorphism, universal example] $MO \sm MO \simeq MO \sm \Susp^\infty_+ BO$.\todo{Is it clear that this is an equivalence of $MO$--modules? This should come from the $x$--factor being unmolested, right?}\todo{Is it furthermore clear that the cohomological version of this gives an action of $E^* X$ on $E^* T(\xi)$ by the ``Thom diagonal''?}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Stringing together the naturality properties of the Thom functor outlined above, we can thus make the following calculation:\todo{This Q.E.D.\ block isn't typeset well.}
\begin{align*}
T(\mu \circ (J_{\R} \times J_{\R})) & \simeq T(\mu \circ (J_{\R} \times J_{\R}) \circ \sigma) & \text{(homotopy invariance)} \\
& \simeq T(\mu \circ (J_{\R} \times 0)) & \text{(constructed lift)} \\
& \simeq T(J_{\R}) \sm T(0) & \text{(monoidality)} \\
& \simeq MO \sm \Susp^\infty_+ BO & \text{(definition of $MO$, \Cref{TrivialBundleThomExample})} \\
T(J_{\R}) \sm T(J_{\R}) & \simeq MO \sm \Susp^\infty_+ BO & \text{(monoidality)} \\
MO \sm MO & \simeq MO \sm \Susp^\infty_+ BO. & \text{(definition of $MO$) \qedhere}
\end{align*}
\end{proof}

From here, the general version of Thom's theorem follows quickly:
\begin{theorem}[Thom isomorphism]
Let $\xi: X \to BO$ classify a vector bundle and let $\phi: MO \to E$ be a map of ring spectra. Then there is an equivalence of $E$--modules \[E \sm T(\xi) \simeq E \sm \Susp^\infty_+ X.\]
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}[Modifications to above proof]
To accommodate $X$ rather than $BO$ as the base, we redefine $\sigma: BO \times X \to BO \times X$ by \[\sigma(x, y) = \sigma(x \xi(y)^{-1}, y).\]  This gives an equivalence $MO \sm T(\xi) \simeq MO \sm \Susp^\infty_+ X$.  To introduce $E$, note that there is a diagram
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
E \sm T(\xi) \arrow[densely dotted]{r}{\simeq} \arrow{d}{\eta_{MO} \sm \id \sm \id} & E \sm \Susp^\infty_+ X \arrow{d}{\eta_{MO} \sm \id \sm \id} \\
MO \sm E \sm T(\xi) \arrow{r}{\simeq} \arrow{d}{(\mu \circ (\phi \sm \id)) \sm \id} & MO \sm E \sm \Susp^\infty_+ X \arrow{d}{(\mu \circ (\phi \sm \id)) \sm \id} \\
E \sm T(\xi) \arrow{r} & E \sm \Susp^\infty_+ X.
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
The middle equivalence comes from the previous Thom isomorphism, smashed through with $E$.  The bottom arrow exists by applying the action map to both sides.  Reusing the bottom arrow at the top arrow and using the unitality of the monoid $E$ shows the map to be an equivalence.
\end{proof}

We'll close out today by using this to actually make a calculation of something. Recall from \Cref{RPnThomExample} that $T(\L - 1 \downarrow \RP^n) = \RP^{n+1}$.  By killing all the homotopy elements in positive degrees, you can also see that the map $MO \to MO(-\infty, 0] = H\Z/2$ is a ring map\todo{This requires some justification, like $MO$ being connective.}, so that we can apply the Thom isomorphism theorem to the mod--$2$ homology of Thom complexes coming from real vector bundles:
\begin{align*}
\pi_* (H\Z/2 \sm T(\L - 1)) & \cong \pi_* (H\Z/2 \sm T(0)) & \text{(Thom isomorphism)} \\
\pi_* (H\Z/2 \sm \Susp^{-1} \Susp^\infty \RP^{n+1}) & \cong \pi_* (H\Z/2 \sm \Susp^\infty_+ \RP^n) & \text{(\Cref{RPnThomExample})} \\
\widetilde{H\Z/2}_{*+1} \RP^{n+1} & \cong H\Z/2_* \RP^n. & \text{(generalized homology)}
\end{align*}
This powers an induction that shows that $H\Z/2_* \RP^\infty$ has a single class in every degree.\todo{Using the cohomology version of this together with the $H\Z/2^* \RP^n$--module structure of $H\Z/2^* T(\L-1)$ deduces the ring structure too.}






\section{Jan 29: Cohomology rings and affine schemes}

\todo{Decide on $\Z/2$ versus $\F_2$. I think in the previous lecture you were avoiding $\F_2$ because it got in the way of your homology subscripts.}An abbreviated summary of this semester is that we're going to put ``$\Spec$'' in front of rings appearing in algebraic topology and see what happens.  Before doing any algebraic topology, let me remind you what this means on the level of algebra.  The core idea is to replace a ring $R$ by the functor it corepresents.  For any ``test $\F_2$--algebra'' $T$, we set \[\Spec(R)(T) := \CatOf{Schemes}_{/\F_2}(\Spec T, \Spec R) := \CatOf{Algebras}_{\F_2/}(R, T).\]  More generally, we have the following definition:
\begin{definition}
An \textit{affine $\F_2$--scheme} is a functor $X: \CatOf{Algebras}_{\F_2/} \to \CatOf{Sets}$ which is (noncanonically) isomorphic to $\Spec R$ for some $\F_2$--algebra $R$.
\end{definition}

The centerpiece of thinking about rings in this way is to translate between a presentation of $R$ as a quotient of a free algebra and a presentation of $(\Spec R)(T)$ as selecting tuples of elements in $T$ subject to certain conditions.  Consider the following example:
\begin{example}
Set $R_1 = \F_2[x]$.  Then \[(\Spec R_1)(T) = \CatOf{Algebras}_{\F_2/}(\F_2[x], T)\] is determined by where $x$ is sent --- i.e., this Hom--set is naturally isomorphic to $T$ itself.  Consider also what happens when we impose a relation by passing to $R_2 = \F_2[x] / (x^{n+1})$.  The value \[(\Spec R_2)(T) = \CatOf{Algebras}_{\F_2/}(\F_2[x] / (x^{n+1}), T)\] of the associated affine scheme is again determined by where $x$ is sent, but now $x$ can only be sent to elements which are nilpotent of order $n+1$.  These schemes are both important enough that we give them special names:
\begin{align*}
\mathbb A^1 & := \Spec \F_2[x], & \mathbb A^{1, (n)} & := \Spec \F_2[x] / (x^{n+1}).
\end{align*}
The symbol ``$\mathbb A^1$'' is pronounced ``the affine line''.  Note that the quotient map $R_1 \to R_2$ induces an inclusion $\mathbb A^{1, (n)} \to \mathbb A^1$ and that $\mathbb A^{1, (0)}$ is a constant functor: \[\mathbb A^{1, (0)}(T) = \{f: \F_2[x] \to T \mid f(x) = 0\}.\]  Accordingly, we pronounce ``$\mathbb A^{1, (0)}$'' as ``the origin on the affine line'' and ``$\mathbb A^{1, (n)}$'' as ``the $n${\th} order neighborhood of the origin in the affine line''.
\end{example}

\todo{Talk more about subobjects?  Say what a closed subscheme of an affine scheme is?}
\todo{Talk about how maps to $\mathbb A^1$ gives an inverse to $\Spec$.}
\todo{Note that $\mathbb G_m$ includes into both $\mathbb A^2$ and $\mathbb A^1$.}

We can also express in this language another common object in algebraic topology: the Hopf algebra, which arises when taking the mod--$2$ cohomology of an $H$--space.  In addition to the usual cohomology, the extra pieces of data are those induced by the $H$--space multiplication and unit map, which on cohomology beget a diagonal map $\Delta$ and an antipode map $\chi$.  Running through the axioms, one quickly checks the following:
\begin{lemma}
For a Hopf $\F_2$--algebra $R$, the functor $\Spec R$ is naturally valued in groups.  Such functors are called \textit{group schemes}.  Conversely, a choice of group structure on $(\Spec R)(T)$ natural in $T$ endows $R$ with the structure of a Hopf algebra. \todo{Maybe write this out, if you're going to be using this equivalence all semester.} \qed
\end{lemma}

\begin{example}\label{InformalAdditiveGroupExample}
The functor $\mathbb A^1$ introduced above is naturally valued in groups: since $\mathbb A^1(T) \cong T$, we can use the addition on $T$ to make it into an abelian group.  When considering $\mathbb A^1$ with this group scheme structure, we notate it as $\mathbb G_a$.  Applying the Yoneda lemma, one deduces the following formulas for the Hopf algebra structure maps:
\begin{align*}
\mathbb G_a \times \mathbb G_a & \xrightarrow{\mu} \mathbb G_a & x_1 + x_2 & \mapsfrom x, \\
\mathbb G_a & \xrightarrow{\chi} \mathbb G_a & -x & \mapsfrom x, \\
\Spec \F_2 & \xrightarrow{\eta} \mathbb G_a & 0 & \mapsfrom x.
\end{align*}
\end{example}

\begin{example}
We define the \textit{multiplicative group scheme} by\todo{Do you want this to be a $\Z$--algebra? Ditto with $\mathbb A^1$ and $\mathbb G_a$?} \[\mathbb G_m = \Spec \F_2[x, y] / (xy - 1).\]  Its value $\mathbb G_m(T)$ on a test algebra $T$ is the set of pairs $(x, y)$ such that $y$ is a multiplicative inverse to $x$, and hence $\mathbb G_m$ is valued in groups.  Applying the Yoneda lemma, we deduce the following formulas for the Hopf algebra structure maps:
\begin{align*}
\mathbb G_m \times \mathbb G_m & \xrightarrow{\mu} \mathbb G_m & x_1 \otimes x_2 & \mapsfrom x \\
& & y_1 \otimes y_2 & \mapsfrom y, \\
\mathbb G_m & \xrightarrow{\chi} \mathbb G_m & (y, x) & \mapsfrom (x, y), \\
\Spec R & \xrightarrow{\eta} \mathbb G_m & 1 & \mapsfrom x, y.
\end{align*}
\end{example}

Let's now consider the example that we closed with last time, where we calculated $H\Z/2^*(\RP^n) = \F_2[x] / (x^{n+1})$.  Putting ``$\Spec$'' in front of this, we could reinterpret this calculation as \[\Spec H\F_2^*(\RP^n) \cong \mathbb A^{1, (n)}.\]  This is such a useful thing to do that we will give it a notation all of its own:

\begin{definition}
Let $X$ be a finite cell complex, so that $H\F_2^*(X)$ is a ring which is finite--dimensional as an $\F_2$--vector space.  We will write \[X_{H\F_2} = \Spec H\F_2^* X\] for the corresponding finite affine scheme.
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
Putting together the discussions from this time and last time, in the new notation we have calculated \[\RP^n_{H\Z/2} \cong \mathbb A^{1, (n)}.\]
\end{example}

So far, this example just restates things we knew in a mildly different language.  Our driving goal for the remainder of today and for tomorrow is to incorporate as much information as we have about these cohomology rings $H\F_2^* \RP^n$ into this description, which will result in us giving a more ``precise'' name for this object.  Along the way, we will discover why $X$ had to be a \emph{finite} complex and how to think about more general $X$.  For now, though, let's content ourselves with investigating the Hopf algebra structure on $H\F_2^* \RP^\infty$.

\begin{example}\label{RPExampleFaulty}
Recall that $\RP^\infty$ is an $H$--space in two equivalent ways:
\begin{enumerate}
\item There is an identification $\RP^\infty \simeq K(\Z/2, 1)$, and the $H$--space structure is induced by the sum on cohomology.
\item There is an identification $\RP^\infty \simeq BO(1)$, and the $H$--space structure is induced by the tensor product of real line bundles.
\end{enumerate}
In both cases, this induces a Hopf algebra diagonal \[H\F_2^* \RP^\infty \otimes H\F_2^* \RP^\infty \xleftarrow\Delta H\F_2^* \RP^\infty\] which we would like to analyze.  This map is determined by where it sends the class $x$, and because it must simultaneously respect gradings it must be of the form $\Delta x = ax_1 + bx_2$ for some constants $a, b \in \F_2$.  Furthermore, because it belongs to a Hopf algebra structure, it must satisfy the unitality axiom
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
H\F_2^* \RP^\infty \arrow[leftarrow]{r}{\begin{array}{c} \epsilon \otimes \id \\ \id \otimes \epsilon \end{array}} \arrow[leftarrow, bend right]{rr}{\id} & H\F_2^* \RP^\infty \otimes H\F_2^* \RP^\infty \arrow[leftarrow]{r}{\Delta} & H\F_2^* \RP^\infty.
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
and hence it takes the form \[\Delta(x) = x_1 + x_2.\]  Noticing that this is exactly the diagonal map in \Cref{InformalAdditiveGroupExample}, we tentatively identify ``$\RP^\infty_{H\F_2}$'' with the additive group.  This is extremely suggestive but does not take into account the fact that $\RP^\infty$ is an infinite complex, so we haven't allowed ourselves to write ``$\RP^\infty_{H\F_2}$'' just yet.  We will straighten this out tomorrow.
\end{example}








\section{Feb 1: The Steenrod algebra}


We left off yesterday complaining that our definition was only made for finite complexes, and that this was getting in the way of a nice theorem.  However, had we naively defined $X_{H\F_2}$ for infinite complexes $X$, we would have quickly seen that we would have gotten ``the wrong answer'' for several $X$.  Without going into detail yet about the bad examples we're trying to avoid, it will turn out that we can fix them by rigidifying the target category somewhat.  Here are the extra structures we will work toward incorporating, some quickly and some slowly:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Cohomology rings are \emph{graded}, and maps of spaces respect this grading.
\item Cohomology rings receive an action of the Steenrod algebra, and maps of spaces respect this action.
\item Both of these are complicated further when taking the cohomology of an infinite complex.
\item \label{SkewCommutativeDeficiency} (Cohomology rings for more elaborate cohomology theories are only skew-commutative, but ``$\Spec$'' requires a commutative input.)
\end{enumerate}
Today we will fix all these deficiencies of $X_{H\F_2}$ except for \#\ref{SkewCommutativeDeficiency}, which doesn't matter with mod--$2$ coefficients but which will be something of a bugbear throughout the rest of the semester.

Let's begin by considering the grading on $H\F_2^* X$.  There is a standard construction in algebraic geometry that tracks gradings, which we now recall:

\begin{definition}\todo{Cite: Strickland FSFG, Defn 2.95.}
A \textit{grading} on a ring $R$ is a system of additive subgroups $R_k$ of $R$ satisfying $R = \bigoplus_k R_k$, $1 \in R_0$, and $R_j R_k \subseteq R_{j+k}$.  Additionally, a map $f: R \to S$ of graded rings is said to be \textit{homogeneous} or to \textit{respect the grading} if $f(R_k) \subseteq S_k$.
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}\label{GradedAndGmEquivAgree}\todo{Cite this: Strickland FSFG, Prop 2.96.}
A graded ring $R$ is equivalent data to an affine scheme $\Spec R$ with an action by $\mathbb G_m$.  Additionally, a map $R \to S$ is homogeneous exactly when the induced map $\Spec S \to \Spec R$ is $\mathbb G_m$--equivariant.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
A $\mathbb G_m$--action on $\Spec R$ is equivalent data to a coaction map $\alpha^*: R \to R \otimes \F_2[x^\pm]$.  Define $R_k$ to be those points in $r$ satisfying $\alpha^* r = r \otimes x^k$.  It is clear that we have $1 \in R_0$ and that $R_j R_k \subseteq R_{j+k}$.  To see that $R = \bigoplus_k R_k$, note that every tensor can be written as a sum of pure tensors.  Conversely, given a graded ring $R$, define the coaction map on $R_k$ by \[(r_k \in R_k) \mapsto x^k r_k\] and extend linearly.
\end{proof}

This notion from algebraic geometry is somewhat different from what we are used to in algebraic topology, as it is designed to deal with things like polynomial rings, but in classical algebraic topology we only ever encounter homogeneous sums.  We can modify our perspectively very slightly to arrive at the algebraic geometers': replace $H\F_2$ by the periodified spectrum \[H\F_2P = \bigvee_{j=-\infty}^\infty \Susp^j H\F_2.\]  This spectrum has the property that $H\F_2P^0(X)$ is isomorphic to $H\F_2^*(X)$ as ungraded rings, but now we can make sense of the sum of two classes which used to live in different $H\F_2$--degrees.  At this point we can manually craft the desired coaction map $\alpha^*$ so that we are in the situation of \Cref{GradedAndGmEquivAgree}, but we will shortly find that algebraic topology gifts us with it on its own.

Our route to finding this natural $\alpha^*$ is by turning to the next extra structure: the action of the Steenrod algebra.  Naively approached, this does not fit into the framework we've been sketching so far: the Steenrod algebra is a noncommutative algebra, and so the action map \[\mathcal A^* \otimes H\F_2^* X \to H\F_2^* X\] will be difficult to squeeze into any kind of algebro-geometric framework.  Milnor was the first person to see a way around this, with two crucial observations.  First, the linear-algebraic dual of the Steenrod algebra $\mathcal A_*$ is a commutative ring, since the Cartan formula expressing the diagonal on $\mathcal A^*$ is evidently symmetric.  Second, if $X$ is a \emph{finite} complex, then tinkering with Spanier--Whitehead duality gives rise to a map: \[\mathcal A^* \otimes (H\F_2)_* X \to (H\F_2)_* X.\]  Applying linear-algebraic duality to this bottom map allows us to reinterpret this as a coaction map \[\lambda^*: H\F_2^* X \to H\F_2^* X \otimes \mathcal A_*,\] which we will then re-re-interpret as an action map \[\alpha: \Spec \mathcal A_* \times X_{H\F_2} \to X_{H\F_2}.\]  Milnor works out the Hopf algebra structure of $\mathcal A_*$, by defining elements $\xi_j \in \mathcal A_*$ dual to $\Sq^{2^{j-1}} \cdots \Sq^{2^0} \in \mathcal A^*$.  Taking $X = \RP^n$ and $x \in H\F_2^1(\RP^n)$ the generator, then since $\Sq^{2^{j-1}} \cdots \Sq^{2^0} x = x^{2^j}$ he deduces the formula \[\lambda^*(x) = \sum_{j=0}^{\lfloor \log_2 n \rfloor} x^{2^j} \otimes \xi_j.\]  Notice that we can take the limit $n \to \infty$ if we aren't afraid of infinite sums.  He then makes the following calculation, stable in $n$:
\begin{align*}
(\lambda^* \otimes \id) \circ \lambda^*(x) & = (\id \otimes \Delta) \circ \lambda^*(x) & \text{(coaction)} \\
(\lambda^* \otimes \id) \left( \sum_{j=0}^\infty x^{2^j} \otimes \xi_j \right) & = \\
\sum_{j=0}^\infty \left( \sum_{i=0}^\infty x^{2^i} \otimes \xi_i \right)^{2^j} \otimes \xi_j & = & \text{(ring homomorphism)} \\
\sum_{j=0}^\infty \left( \sum_{i=0}^\infty x^{2^{i+j}} \otimes \xi_i^{2^j} \right) \otimes \xi_j & = & \text{(characteristic $2$)} \\
\sum_{j=0}^\infty \left( \sum_{i=0}^\infty x^{2^{i+j}} \otimes \xi_i^{2^j} \right) \otimes \xi_j & = (\id \otimes \Delta) \left( \sum_{m=0}^\infty x^{2^m} \otimes \xi_m \right) \\
\sum_{j=0}^\infty \left( \sum_{i=0}^\infty x^{2^{i+j}} \otimes \xi_i^{2^j} \right) \otimes \xi_j & = \sum_{m=0}^\infty x^{2^m} \otimes \Delta(\xi_m),
\end{align*}
from which it follows that \[\Delta \xi_m = \sum_{i+j=m} \xi_i^{2^j} \otimes \xi_j.\]  Finally, Milnor shows that this is the complete story:
\begin{theorem}[Milnor]
$\mathcal A_* = \F_2[\xi_1, \xi_2, \ldots, \xi_j, \ldots]$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}[Flippant proof]
Milnor counts how many elements he has produced, compares against how many Adem and Cartan found, and sees that he has exactly enough.
\end{proof}

We are now in a position to uncover the desired map $\alpha^*$ desired earlier.  Suppose that we were interested in re-telling Milnor's story with $H\F_2P$ in place of $H\F_2$.  The dual Steenrod algebra is defined by \[\mathcal A_* := \pi_*(H\F_2 \sm H\F_2),\] which we replace by \[\mathcal AP_0 := \pi_0 (H\F_2 P \sm H\F_2 P) = H\F_2P_0(H\F_2) = \mathcal A_*[\xi_0^\pm].\]  Restricting to the quotient Hopf algebra $\mathcal AP_0 \to \F_2[\xi_0^\pm]$ gives exactly the coaction map $\alpha^*$.

To study the rest of $\mathcal AP_0$ in terms of algebraic geometry, we need only identify what the series $\lambda^*(x)$ embodies.  Note that this necessarily involves some creativity, and the only justification we can supply will be moral, borne out over time.  With that caveat in mind, here is one such description.  Recall the map induced by the $H$--space multiplication \[H\F_2^* \RP^\infty \otimes H\F_2^* \RP^\infty \leftarrow H\F_2^* \RP^\infty.\]  Taking a colimit over finite complexes, we produce an coaction of $\mathcal A_*$, and since the map above comes from a map of spaces, it is equivariant for the coaction.  Since the action on the left is diagonal, we deduce the formula \[\lambda^*(x_1 + x_2) = \lambda^*(x_1) + \lambda^*(x_2).\]

\begin{lemma}
The series $\lambda^*(x) = \sum_{j=0}^\infty x^{2^j} \otimes \xi_j$ is the universal example of a series satisfying $\lambda^*(x_1 + x_2) = \lambda^*(x_1) + \lambda^*(x_2)$.  The value $(\Spec \mathcal AP_0)(T)$ is the set of power series $f$ with coefficients in $T$ satisfying \[f(x_1 + x_2) = f(x_1) + f(x_2). \qed\]
\end{lemma}

We close our discussion by codifying what Milnor did when he stabilized against $n$.  Each $\RP^n_{H\F_2}$ is a finite affine scheme, and to make sense of the object $\RP^\infty_{H\F_2}$ Milnor's technique was to consider the ind-system $\{\RP^n_{H\F_2}\}_{n=0}^\infty$ of finite affine schemes.  We give a name to these sorts of objects:\todo{Maybe move formal schemes into the previous lecture and talk about completions too?}
\begin{definition}
An \textit{affine formal scheme} is an ind-system of finite affine schemes.
\end{definition}
\noindent We will follow this technique ourselves to handle general infinite complexes:
\begin{definition}
When $X$ is an infinite complex, filter it by its subskeleta $X^{(n)}$ and define $X_{H\F_2}$ to be the ind-system $\{X^{(n)}_{H\F_2}\}_{n=0}^\infty$ of finite schemes.
\end{definition}

This choice clarifies the example from last time:
\begin{example}[{cf. \Cref{RPExampleFaulty}}]\label{RPinftyExampleForReal}
Write $\G_a$ for the ind-system $\mathbb A^{1, (n)}$ with the group scheme structure given in \Cref{RPExampleFaulty}.  That this group scheme structure filters this way is a simultaneous reflection of two facts:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\G_a(T)$ consists of all nilpotent elements in $T$.  The sum of two nilpotent elements of orders $n$ and $m$ is guaranteed to itself be nilpotent with order at most $n+m$.
\item There is a skeletal factorization of the multiplication map on $\RP^\infty$ as $\RP^n \times \RP^m \to \RP^{n+m}$ purely for dimensional reasons.\todo{Is there an off-by-one here?}
\end{enumerate}
As group schemes, we have calculated \[\RP^\infty_{H\F_2} \cong \G_a.\]
\end{example}

Additionally, this choice allows us to give a name to $\Spec \mathcal AP_0$.  Note that the following morphism sets are very different:
\begin{align*}
\CatOf{GroupSchemes}_{/\F_2}(\mathbb G_a, \mathbb G_a) & \cong \CatOf{HopfAlgebras}_{\F_2/}(\F_2[x], \F_2[x]) \\
\CatOf{FormalGroups}_{/\F_2}(\G_a, \G_a) & \cong \CatOf{HopfProAlgebras}_{\F_2/}(\F_2\llbracket x \rrbracket, \F_2\llbracket x \rrbracket).
\end{align*}
The former is populated by polynomials satisfying the homomorphism condition and the latter is populated by power series satisfying the homomorphism condition.  Since our description of $\Spec \mathcal AP_0$ involves power series, we can amp up this observation to a scheme: \[\underline{\operatorname{Hom}}(X, Y)(T) = \left\{ (u, f) \middle| \begin{array}{c} u: \Spec T \to \Spec \F_2, \\ f: u^* X \to u^* Y \end{array}\right\}\] and conclude that the correct name for $\Spec \mathcal AP_0$ is \[\Spec \mathcal AP_0 \cong \underline{\Aut}(\G_a).\]

Finally, the formula $\RP^\infty_{H\F_2} \cong \G_a$ is meant to point out that this language of formal schemes has an extremely good compression ratio: you can fit a lot of information into a very tiny space.  This formula simultaneously embodies the cohomology ring of $\RP^\infty$, its diagonal, and how the dual Steenrod algebra coacts.

\section{Feb 3: Comodule cohomology I: Group cohomology}

\todo{This section is written gradedly and probably shouldn't be, for consistency.} Today we'll focus on an important classical tool: the Adams spectral sequence.  We're going to study this in greater earnest later on, so I will avoid giving a satisfying construction today.  But, even without a construction, it's instructive to see how such a thing comes about.  \todo{I first saw this presentation from Matt Ando. He must have learned it from someone. I'd like to know who to attribute this to.}  Begin by considering the following three self-maps of the stable sphere:
\begin{align*}
\S^0 & \xrightarrow{0} \S^0, & \S^0 & \xrightarrow{1} \S^0, & \S^0 & \xrightarrow{2} \S^0.
\end{align*}
If we apply mod--$2$ cohomology to each line, the induced maps are
\begin{align*}
\F_2 & \xleftarrow{0} \F_2, & \F_2 & \xleftarrow{\id} \F_2, & \F_2 & \xleftarrow{0} \F_2.
\end{align*}
We see that mod--$2$ homology can immediately distinguish between the null map and the identity map just by its behavior on morphisms, but it can't so distinguish between the null map and the multiplication-by-$2$ map.  To try to distinguish these two, we use the only other tool available to us: cohomology theories send cofiber sequences to long exact sequences, and moreover the data of a map $f$ and the data of the inclusion map $\S^0 \to C(f)$ into its cone are equivalent in the stable category.  So, we trade our maps $0$ and $2$ for the following cofiber sequences:
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
\S^0 \arrow{r} & C(0) \arrow{r} & \S^1, & \S^0 \arrow{r} & C(2) \arrow{r} & \S^1.
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
Applying cohomology, these again appear to be the same:
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}[column sep=1.0em]
{[1]} & & \bullet & \arrow{l} \bullet & & \bullet & \arrow{l} \bullet \\
{[0]} & \bullet & \arrow{l} \bullet & & \bullet & \arrow{l} \bullet \\
& H\F_2^* \S^0 & \arrow{l} H\F_2^* C(0) & \arrow{l} H\F_2^* \S^1, & H\F_2^* \S^0 & \arrow{l} H\F_2^* C(2) & \arrow{l} H\F_2^* \S^1,
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
where we have drawn a ``$\bullet$'' for a generator of an $\F_2$--vector space, graded vertically, and arrows indicating the behavior of each map.  However, if we enrich our picture with the data we discussed last time, we can finally see the difference.  Recall the topological equivalences \[C(0) \simeq \S^0 \vee \S^1, \quad C(2) \simeq \Susp^{-1} \RP^1.\]  In the two cases, the coaction map $\lambda^*$ is given by
\begin{align*}
\lambda^*: H\F_2^* C(0) & \to H\F_2^* C(0) \otimes \mathcal A_* & \lambda^*: H\F_2^* C(2) & \to H\F_2^* C(2) \\
\lambda^*: e_0 & \mapsto e_0 \otimes 1 & \lambda^*: e_0 & \mapsto e_0 \otimes 1 + e_1 \otimes \xi_1 \\
\lambda^*: e_1 & \mapsto e_1 \otimes 1, & \lambda^*: e_1 & \mapsto e_1 \otimes 1.
\end{align*}
We draw this into the diagram as
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}[column sep=1.0em]
{[1]} & & \bullet & \arrow{l} \bullet & & \bullet \arrow[-]{d} & \arrow{l} \bullet \\
{[0]} & \bullet & \arrow{l} \bullet & & \bullet & \arrow{l} \bullet \\
& H\F_2^* \S^0 & \arrow{l} H\F_2^* C(0) & \arrow{l} H\F_2^* \S^1, & H\F_2^* \S^0 & \arrow{l} H\F_2^* C(2) & \arrow{l} H\F_2^* \S^1,
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
where the vertical line indicates the nontrivial coaction involving $\xi_1$.  We can now see what trading maps for cofiber sequences has bought us: mod--$2$ cohomology can distinguish the defining sequences for $C(0)$ and $C(2)$ by considering their induced extensions of comodules over $\mathcal A_*$.\todo{Can this be phrased so as to indicate how this works for longer extensions? I've never tried to think about even what happens for $C(4)$.}  The Adams spectral sequence bundles this thought process into a single machine, of signature \[\Ext_{\mathcal A_*}^{*, *}(\F_2, \F_2) \Rightarrow (\pi_* \S^0)^\wedge_2.\]  In effect, this asserts that the above process is \emph{exhaustive}: every element of $(\pi_* \S^0)^\wedge_2$ can be detected by some representative class of extensions of comodules for the dual Steenrod algebra.  Mildly more generally, if $X$ is a bounded-below spectrum, then there is even a spectral sequence of signature\todo{How do you feel about this sub-star notation without parens?}\todo{Mention that there are homological and cohomological $\F_2$--Adams spectral sequences.} \[\Ext_{\mathcal A_*}^{*, *}(\F_2, H\F_{2*} X) \Rightarrow \pi_* X^\wedge_2.\]

Here is where we could divert to talking about the construction of the Adams spectral sequence.  There is a light presentation which we could think about now, but it will fit nicely into a story later on.  So, we will leave this task for later in the semester, when we can do a better job of it.  For now, we will record the following utility lemma about the Adams spectral sequence, which we will need to use before we get around to giving a good construction:
\begin{lemma}
The $0$--line of the Adams spectral sequence contains those elements visible to the Hurewicz homomorphism. \qed \todo{This feels sloppily stated.}
\end{lemma}

Instead, today we will focus on the meaning of the algebraic input $\Ext_{\mathcal A_*}^{*, *}(\F_2, H\F_{2*} X)$, which will require us to grapple some with the homological algebra of comodules for a Hopf algebra.  To begin, it's both reassuring and instructive to see that homological algebra can, in fact, be done with comodules.  In the usual development of homological algebra for modules, the key observations are the existence of projective and injective modules, and something similar is at work here.\todo{Come back to this and either state things generally (at least set $k = \F_2$?) so you can use it in Comodule Cohomology II, or specialize it to get rid of all these pesky $A$s.}
\begin{lemma}\todo{Cite these. A1.1-2 in Ravenel are relevant?}
Let $A$ be a Hopf $k$--algebra, let $M$ be an $A$--comodule, and let $N$ be a $k$--module.  Then there is a \textit{cofree adjunction}: \[\CatOf{Comodules}_A(M, N \otimes_k A) \cong \CatOf{Modules}_k(M, N),\] where $N \otimes_k A$ is given the structure of an $A$--comodule by the coaction map \[N \otimes_k A \xrightarrow{\id \otimes \Delta} N \otimes_k (A \otimes_k A) = (N \otimes_k A) \otimes_k A.\]
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
We will describe the assignments involved in the adjunction.  Given a map $f: M \to N$ of $k$--modules, we build the composite \[M \xrightarrow{\psi_M} M \otimes_k A \xrightarrow{f \otimes \id_A} N \otimes_k A.\]  Alternatively, given a map $g: M \to N \otimes_k A$ of $A$--comodules, we build the composite \[M \xrightarrow{g} N \otimes_k A \xrightarrow{\id_N \otimes \eps} N \otimes_k k = N. \qedhere\]
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
The category $\CatOf{Comodules}_A$ has enough injectives.  Namely, if $M$ is an $A$--comodule and $M \to I$ is an inclusion of $k$--modules into an injective $k$--module $I$, then $M \to I \otimes_k A$ is an injective $A$--comodule under $M$. \qed
\end{corollary}
\begin{remark}
In our case, $M$ itself is always injective, so there's already an injective map $\psi_M: M \to M \otimes A$: the coaction map.  The assertion that this map is coassociative is identical to saying that it is a map of comodules.
\end{remark}

\textbf{While we're here, let's record some facts about base change.}\todo{Put filler here.}

\begin{definition}
Given $A$--comodules $M$ and $N$, their cotensor product is defined by the coequalizer \[M \cotensor_A N \to M \otimes_k N \xrightarrow{\psi_M \otimes 1 - 1 \otimes \psi_N} M \otimes_k A \otimes_k N.\]
\end{definition}

\noindent Cotensoring gives rise to a concise description of what it means to be a comodule map:

\begin{lemma}\todo{Cite Ravenel: A1.1.6b}
Let $M$ and $N$ be $A$--comodules with $M$ projective as a $k$--module.  Then there is an equivalence \[\CatOf{Comodules}_A(M, N) = \CatOf{Modules}_k(M, k) \cotensor_A N. \qed\]
\end{lemma}

\begin{corollary}
Let $N = N' \otimes_k A$ be a cofree comodule. Then $N \cotensor_A k = N'$.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
Picking $M = k$, we have
\begin{align*}
\CatOf{Modules}_k(k, N') & = \CatOf{Comodules}_A(k, N) \\
& = \CatOf{Modules}_A(A, k) \cotensor_A N \\
& = k \cotensor_A N. \qedhere
\end{align*}
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
There is an isomorphism \[\CatOf{Comodules}_A(k, N) = \CatOf{Modules}_k(k, k) \cotensor_A N = k \cotensor_A N\] and hence \[\Ext_A(k, N) \cong \Cotor_A(k, N).\]
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
Resolve $N$ using the cofree modules described above, then apply either functor $\CatOf{Comodules}_A(k, -)$ or $k \cotensor_A -$.  In both cases, you get the same complex.
\end{proof}

\todo{Put a better base-change theorem here, like $- \cotensor_A B$.}

\begin{example}
Let's work to contextualize this somewhat.  Given a finite group $G$, we can form a commutative Hopf algebra $k^G$, the $k$--valued functions on $G$.  This Hopf algebra is dual to the Hopf algebra $k[G]$, the group--algebra on $G$.  It is classical that a $G$--module $M$ is equivalent data to a $k[G]$--module structure, and if $M$ is suitably finite, we can dualize the action map to produce a coaction map \[M^* \to k^G \otimes M^*.\]  \todo{Now check that $M^* \cotensor_{k^G} k = (H^0 M)^*$.}
\end{example}

\todo{$\mathcal A(1)_*$ is the Hopf algebra for a dihedral group. Is this example appropriate here?}

\begin{example}
In the previous lecture, we identified $\mathcal A_*$ with the ring of functions on the group scheme $\underline{\Aut}(\G_a)$.  Today's punchline is that this is analogous to the example above: $\Cotor_{\mathcal A_*}(\F_2, H\F_{2*} X)$ computes the derived fixed points of $G = \underline{\Aut}(\G_a)$ on the $G$--module $H\F_{2*} X$.
\end{example}

\begin{example}
Consider the degenerate case $X = H\F_2$.  Then $H\F_{2*}(H\F_2) = \mathcal A_*$ is a cofree comodule, and hence $\Cotor$ is concentrated on the $0$--line: \[\Cotor_{\mathcal A_*}(\F_2, H\F_{2*}(H\F_2)) = \F_2.\]  The Adams spectral sequence collapses to show the wholly unsurprising equality $\pi_* H\F_2 = \F_2$, and indeed this is the element in the image of the Hurewicz map $\pi_* H\F_2 \to H\F_{2*} H\F_2$.

\section{Feb 5: The unoriented bordism ring}

the splitting principle

$MO$--orientations agree with factorizations of the unit through $MO(1)$

identification of $MO^{H\F_2}$ with $\Coord(\RP^\infty_{H\F_2})$

Hood made the following nice observation. $MO^{H\F_2}$ is the scheme of coordinates on $\RP^\infty_{H\F_2}$, with coordinate ring $\F_2[x_1, x_2, \ldots]$ and corresponding series $f(t) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty x_{n-1} t^n$ and $x_0 = 1$ implicit. This identification is equivalent to Adams's observation that $MO$ is the ``free homotopy ring spectrum'' on $MO(1)$ his sense. Then, $\Spec \mathcal{A}_* = \underline{\operatorname{Aut}}(\G_a)$ acts on this by coordinate changes (and we can pick a left-- or right--action as we see fit). If we pick an action by postcomposition, then we can do the following nice thing: set $f(t) = f_2(t) + g(t)$, where $f_2(t)$ contains just the terms in degrees perfect powers of $2$. Then $f_2^{-1}(f(t))$ is another coordinate with no terms in degrees perfect powers of $2$, and any nontrivial automorphism applied to this ``reduced'' series will re-introduce terms in degrees perfect powers of $2$.  So, this is a canonical form for the series under the $\underline{\operatorname{Aut}}(\G_a)$--action which admits no further automorphisms. It should follow that $H^*(\context{H\F_2}; \context{H\F_2}(MO))$ has amplitude $0$ and takes the form $\F_2[x_j \mid j \ne 2^n - 1]$, i.e., whose generating function is arbitrary other than having no terms in degrees perfect powers of $2$.

This means that the Adams spectral sequence degenerates and this computes $\pi_* MO$.  (It would be nice to interpret this in terms of a logarithm on $\RP^\infty_{H\F_2}$.)  It also means that the Hurewicz map is injective, hence that $MO$ is a retract of $H\F_2 \sm MO$, hence that $MO$ is an $H\F_2$--module, hence that $MO$ is a wedge of shifts of $H\F_2$.

\end{definition}

Sheaves on simplicial schemes, cohomology of sheaves

Since $E$--homology is valued in $E_*$--modules, which by \Cref{QCohDefinition} are also known as quasicoherent sheaves over $\Spec E_*$, we are prompted to recall the following definitions:
\begin{definition}
%\todo{I'd be much happier not citing the stacks project.}
Let $X$ be a simplicial object in affine schemes and let $\sheaf F[n]$ be a quasicoherent sheaf on $X[n]$.\footnote{This is a slight abuse of notation: $\sheaf F[n]$ is not the $n$\th level of a simplicial object.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\sheaf F$ is collectively called a sheaf~\cite[Tag 09VK]{stacks-project} on $X$ when each map $\phi: [m] \to [n]$ inducing a map $X(\phi): X[n] \to X[m]$ naturally induces a sheaf map \[\sheaf F(\phi)_* \co \sheaf F[m] \to X(\phi)_* \sheaf F[n].\]
\item $\sheaf F$ is called quasicoherent~\cite[Tag 07TF]{stacks-project} when it is comprised levelwise of quasicoherent sheaves.
\item $\sheaf F$ is called Cartesian quasicoherent~\cite[Tag 07TF]{stacks-project} when it is quasicoherent and the adjoint map \[\sheaf F(\phi)^* \co X(\phi)^* \sheaf F[m] \to \sheaf F[n]\] is an isomorphism.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

In our specific example, we construct such a sheaf in the following way:

\begin{definition}\label{DefnHomologyFunctorsValuedInSheaves}
For a spectrum $E$ as in \Cref{RingSpToStackDefn} and input spectrum $X$, we define the following diagram of abelian groups:
\[\sheaf{E}(X) := \left\{
\begin{tikzcd}
\pi_* \left( \begin{array}{c} E \\ \sm \\ X \end{array} \right) \arrow[leftarrow, shift left=\baselineskip]{r} \arrow[shift left=(2*\baselineskip)]{r} \arrow{r} &
\pi_* \left( \begin{array}{c} E \\ \sm \\ E \\ \sm \\ X \end{array} \right) \arrow[shift left=(3*\baselineskip)]{r} \arrow[leftarrow, shift left=(2*\baselineskip)]{r} \arrow[shift left=\baselineskip]{r} \arrow[leftarrow]{r} \arrow[shift right=\baselineskip]{r} &
\pi_* \left( \begin{array}{c} E \\ \sm \\ E \\ \sm \\ E \\ \sm \\ X \end{array} \right) \arrow[shift left=(4*\baselineskip)]{r} \arrow[leftarrow, shift left=(3*\baselineskip)]{r} \arrow[shift left=(2*\baselineskip)]{r} \arrow[leftarrow, shift left=\baselineskip]{r} \arrow{r} \arrow[leftarrow, shift right=\baselineskip]{r} \arrow[shift right=(2*\baselineskip)]{r} &
\cdots
\end{tikzcd}
\right\},\]
where all of the coface and codegeneracy maps are induced by the unit map $\S \to E$ and the multiplication map $E \sm E \to E$.  (In particular, $X$ is not involved.)  The $j$\th object is a module for $\sheaf{O}(\sheaf M_E[j])$, and hence determines a quasicoherent sheaf over the scheme $(\sheaf M_E[j])$.  Suitably interpreted, the maps of abelian groups determine maps of pushforwards so that $\sheaf{E}(X)$ is a quasicoherent sheaf over the simplicial scheme $\sheaf M_E$.
\end{definition}

\section{The structure of $\moduli{fg}$ I: Large scales}

Quillen's theorem furnished us with a concrete description of $\context{MU}$ in terms of ``formal groups'', some purely algebraic objects, and we've realized $MU$--homology as being valued in sheaves over $\context{MU}$.  To get as much control on the behavior of $\context{MU}$ as we can, we're now moved to investigate the theory of formal groups.  In particular, many theorems about the behavior of sheaves can be reduced to stalkwise statements, so we will be particularly interested in a classification of the geometric points of $\moduli{fg}$.

Noting that formal group laws arise as analytic germs of multiplication laws on Lie groups, we will first take a cue from Lie theory and attempt to define exponential and logarithm functions for a given formal group law $F$ over a ring $R$.  In Lie theory, this is accomplished by studying left--invariant differentials: a $1$--form $f(x) dx$ is said to be left--invariant under $F$ when \[f(x) dx = f(y +_F x) d(y +_F x) = f(y +_F x) \frac{\partial(y +_F x)}{\partial x} dx.\]  Restricting to the origin by setting $y = 0$, we deduce the condition \[f(0) = f(x) \cdot \left. \frac{\partial(y +_F x)}{\partial x} \right|_{y=0}.\]  If $R$ is a $\Q$--algebra, then setting the boundary condition $f(0) = 1$ and integrating against $x$ yields \[\log_F(x) = \int \left( \left. \frac{\partial(y +_F x)}{\partial x} \right|_{y=0} \right)^{-1} dx.\]  To see that the series $\log_F$ has the claimed homomorphism property, note that \[\frac{\partial \log_F(y +_F x)}{\partial x} = f(y +_F x) d(y +_F x) = f(x) dx = \frac{\partial \log_F(x)}{\partial x},\] so $\log_F(y +_F x)$ and $\log_F(x)$ differ by a constant.  Checking at $x = 0$ shows that the constant is $\log_F(y)$, hence \[\log_F(x +_F y) = \log_F(x) + \log_F(y).\]  We have thus analyzed the rational moduli $\moduli{fg} \times \Spec \Q$:
\begin{theorem}
$\moduli{fg} \times \Spec \Q$ is contractible: every formal group law is uniquely isomorphic to $\G_a$. \qed \todo{What about rescaling? Should you be honest and call this $\moduli{fg}^{(1)}$?}
\end{theorem}

However, if $R$ is not a $\Q$--algebra, then we may not be able to perform power series integration.  Nonetheless, thinking of the $\Q$--algebra restriction as localization at $(0)$, this inspires us to work arithmetically locally at a prime $p$ and consider $\moduli{fg} \times \Spec \Z_{(p)}$.  This task is eased considerably by the following fundamental theorem of Lazard:

\begin{theorem}[Lazard, part 1]
The ring of functions on $\moduli{fgl}$ is polynomial in infinitely many variables.
\end{theorem}

\begin{remark}
His proof does not give a canonical presentation.  Rationally, these are the coordinate functions selecting the logarithm coefficients.
\end{remark}

\begin{corollary}
Given a formal group law $\phi$ over a ring $R$ and a surjective ring map $f: S \to R$, there exists a formal group law $\widetilde \phi$ over $S$ with \[\phi = f^* \widetilde \phi. \qed\]
\end{corollary}

\begin{theorem}[Hazewinkel]
Every formal group law $F$ over a $\Z_{(p)}$--algebra is isomorphic to some $F'$ whose rational logarithm has the form \[\log_{F'}(x) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \ell_n x^{p^n}.\]  It follows that the radius of convergence of $\log_{F'}$ must be $p^d$ for some $d$.\footnote{If $F$ is additive, then $d$ can be infinite.}  The integer $d$ is called the \emph{height} of $F'$.  It is an isomorphism invariant and it is insensitive to lifts along surjective maps from torsion--free $\Z_{(p)}$--algebras. \qed
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}[Landweber, part 2: classification of closed substacks]
Let $BP_*$ be the ring classifying formal group laws with $p$--typical logarithms.
\begin{enumerate}
\item It has the form $BP_* \cong \Z_{(p)}[v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_d, \ldots]$, where $v_d \equiv p \ell_d \pmod{\text{decomposables}}$.
\item The unique closed substack of $\moduli{fg} \times \Spec \Z_{(p)}$ of codimension $d$ is selected by $BP_* / (p, v_1, \ldots, v_{d-1})$, and its complementary open substack of dimension $d$ is selected by either of $v_d^{-1} BP_*$ or $v_d^{-1} \Z_{(p)}[v_1, \ldots, v_d]$.\footnote{It's worth pointing out how strange this is. In Euclidean geometry, open subspaces are always top-dimensional, and closed subspaces can drop dimension.}
\item A $BP_*$--module $M$ gives a flat sheaf on $\moduli{fg}$ exactly when $(p, v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_{d-1}, \ldots)$ is a regular sequence $M$ too.
\item In particular, $BP_*$ is itself such a module, and so gives rise to a homology theory $BP$ with $\M_{BP} \simeq \moduli{fg} \times \Spec \Z_{(p)}$. \qed

Lubin--Tate deformation theories

The nice picture I drew for Catherine



Let $F(x, y)$ be a formal group law over $R$; a deformation of $F$ is a formal group law $F_h(x, y)$ over $R[[h]]$ reducing to $F$ when $h = 0$; an isomorphism of deformations is a strict isomorphism covering the identity on $h = 0$.

Define the deformation complex $C^*(F)$ by \[R \to R\llbracket x_1 \rrbracket \to R\llbracket x_1, x_2 \rrbracket \to R\llbracket x_1, x_2, x_3 \rrbracket \to \cdots\] with differential
\begin{align*}
(df)(x_1, \ldots, x_{n+1}) & = F_1\left(\sum_{i=1}^n {}^F x_i, x_{n+1} \right) \cdot f(x_1, \ldots, x_n) \\
& \quad + \sum (-1)^i f(x_1, \ldots, F(x_i, x_{i+1}), \ldots, x_{n+1}) \\
& \quad (-1)^{n+1} \left( F_2\left(x_1, \sum_{i=2}^{n+1} {}^F x_i \right) \cdot f(x_2, \ldots, x_{n+1}) \right),
\end{align*}
where we have written
\begin{align*}
F_1(x, y) & = \frac{\partial F(x, y)}{\partial x}, &
F_2(x, y) & = \frac{\partial F(x, y)}{\partial y}.
\end{align*}
This is quasi-isomorphic to the usual bar complex. The usual bar complex receives a map defined by \[f \mapsto \check{f}(x_1, \ldots, x_n) = F_1\left( 0, \sum_{i=1}^n {}F x_i \right)^{-1} f(x_1, \ldots, x_n),\] and this is the quasi-isomorphism. You'll probably want to know the formulas
\begin{align*}
F_1(x, y) & = F_1(0, x)^{-1} F_1(0, F(x, y)), \\
F_2(x, y) & = F_2(y, 0)^{-1} F_2(F(x, y), 0) = F_1(0, y)^{-1} F_1(0, F(x, y)).
\end{align*}



\section{The nilpotence theorem}

Every skew field spectrum is a wedge of K(n)s

Definitions of Morava $K$-- and $E$--theory

Yesterday, we developed a rich target for $T(J)$--homology: sheaves over an algebro-geometric object $\M_{T(J)}$.  Furthermore, Quillen's theorem gave an identification $\M_{T(J)} \simeq \moduli{fg}$.  Our initial goal for today is to outline a program by which we can leverage this to study $T(J)$.  Abstractly, one can hope to study any sheaf, including $\M_{T(J)}(X)$, by analyzing its stalks.  The main utility of Quillen's theorem is that it gives us access to a concrete model of $\M_{T(J)}$, so that we can determine where to even look for those stalks.

With this in mind, given a map \[\Spec R \xrightarrow{f} \moduli{fg},\] life would be easiest if the $R$--module determined by $f^* \M_{T(J)}(X)$ were itself the value of a homology theory $R_*(X) = T(J)_* X \otimes_{T(J)_*} R$.  After all, the pullback of some arbitrary sheaf along some arbitrary map has no special behavior, but homology functors do have familiar special behaviors which we could hope to exploit.  Generally, this is unreasonable to expect: homology theories are functors which convert cofiber sequences of spectra to long exact sequences of groups, but base--change from $\moduli{fg}$ to $\Spec R$ preserves exact sequences exactly when $f$ is \textit{flat}.  In that case, this gives the following theorem:

\begin{theorem}[Landweber, part 1]
For any diagram
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
\Spec R \arrow{r}{i} & \moduli{fgl} \arrow[-,double]{r} \arrow{d} & \M_{T(J)}[0] \arrow{d} \arrow[-,double]{r} & \Spec T(J)_* \\
& \moduli{fg} \arrow[-,double]{r} \arrow[leftarrow]{lu}{\mathrm{flat}} & \M_{T(J)}
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
such that the diagonal arrow is flat, the functor \[R_*(X) := T(J)_*(X) \otimes_{T(J)_*} R\] determines a homology theory. 
\end{theorem}

\noindent In the course of proving this theorem, Landweber devised a method to recognize flat maps.  Recall that a map $f$ is flat exactly when for any closed substack $i: A \to \moduli{fg}$ with ideal sheaf $\mathcal I$ there is an exact sequence \[0 \to f^* \mathcal I \to f^* \mathcal O_{\moduli{fg}} \to f^* i_* \mathcal O_A \to 0.\]  Landweber classified the closed substacks of $\moduli{fg}$, thereby giving a method to check maps for flatness.

This appears to be a moot point, however, as it is unreasonable to expect this idea to apply to computing stalks: the inclusion of a closed substack (and so, in particular, a closed point $\Gamma$) is flat only in highly degenerate cases.  This can be repaired: the inclusion of the formal completion of a closed substack of a Noetherian\footnote{$\moduli{fg}$ is not Noetherian, but we will find that each closed point except $\G_a$ lives in an open substack that happens to be Noetherian.} stack is flat, and so we naturally become interested in the infinitesimal deformation spaces of the closed points $\Gamma$ on $\moduli{fg}$.  If we can analyze those, then Landweber's theorem will produce homology theories called $E_\Gamma$.  Moreover, if we find that these deformation spaces are \emph{smooth}, it will follow that their deformation rings support regular sequences.  In this excellent case, by taking the regular quotient we will be able to recover a \emph{homology theory} $K_\Gamma$ which plays the role of computing the stalk of $\M_{T(J)}(X)$ at $\Gamma$.\footnote{Incidentally, this program has no content when applied to $\M_{H\F_2}$, as $\Spec \F_2$ is simply too small.}

----

Having constructed these ``stalk'' homology theories, I want to show that you can actually perform analyses of the kind I was describing at the beginning of today.  Our example case is a famous theorem: the solution of Ravenel's nilpotence conjectures by Devinatz, Hopkins, and Smith.  Their theorem concerns spectra which ``detect nilpotence'' in the following sense:

\begin{definition}
A ring spectrum $E$ \textit{detects nilpotence} if, for any ring spectrum $R$, the kernel of the Hurewicz homomorphism $E_*: \pi_* R \to E_* R$ consists of nilpotent elements.
\end{definition}

First, a word about why one would care about such a condition.  The following theorem is classical:
\begin{theorem}[Nishida]
Every homotopy class $\alpha \in \pi_{\ge 1} \S$ is nilpotent.
\end{theorem}

\noindent However, people studying $K$--theory in the '$70$s discovered the following phenomenon:

\begin{theorem}[Adams]
Let $M_{2n}(p)$ denote the mod--$p$ Moore spectrum with bottom cell in degree $2n$.  Then there is an index $n$ and a map $v: M_{2n}(p) \to M_0(p)$ such that $KU_* v$ acts by multiplication by the $n$\textsuperscript{th}\, power of the Bott class.\footnote{The minimal such $n$ is given by the formula $n = \begin{cases} p-1 & \text{when $p \ge 3$}, \\ 4 & \text{when $p = 2$}. \end{cases}$}
\end{theorem}

\noindent In particular, this means that $v$ cannot be nilpotent, since a null-homotopic map induces the zero map in any homology theory.  Just as we took the non-nilpotent endomorphism $p$ in $\pi_0 \End \S$ and coned it off, we can take the endomorphism $v$ in $\pi_{2p-2} \End M_0(p)$ and cone it off to form a new spectrum called $V(1)$.\footnote{$V(1)$ actually means a finite spectrum with $BP_* V(1) \cong BP_* / (p, v_1)$. At $p = 2$ this spectrum doesn't exist and this is a misnomer.}  Ravenel's burning question was whether the pattern continues: does $V(1)$ have a non-nilpotent self-map, and can we cone it off to form a new such spectrum with a new such map?  Can we then do that again, indefinitely?  In order to study this question, we are motivated to find spectra $E$ as above --- and in fact, we found one yesterday.

\begin{theorem}[Devinatz--Hopkins--Smith, hard]
The spectrum $T(J)$ detects nilpotence.
\end{theorem}

They also show that the $T(J)$ is the universal object which detects nilpotence, in the sense that any other ring spectrum can have this property checked stalkwise on $\M_{T(J)}$:

\begin{theorem}[Hopkins--Smith, easy]
A ring spectrum $E$ detects nilpotence if and only if $K(d)_* E \ne 0$ for all $0 \le d \le \infty$ and for all primes $p$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
If $K(d)_* E = 0$ for some $d$, then the non-nilpotent map $\S \to K(d)$ lies in the kernel of the Hurewicz homomorphism for $E$, so $E$ fails to detect nilpotence.

Hence, for any $d$ we must have $K(d)_* E \ne 0$.  Because $K(d)_*$ is a field, it follows by picking a basis of $K(d)_* E$ that $K(d) \sm E$ is a nonempty wedge of suspensions of $K(d)$.  So, for $\alpha \in \pi_* R$, if $E_* \alpha = 0$ then $(K(d) \sm E)_* \alpha = 0$ and hence $K(d)_* \alpha = 0$.  So, we need to show that if $K(d)_* \alpha = 0$ for all $n$ and all $p$ then $\alpha$ is nilpotent.  Taking Devinatz--Hopkins--Smith as given, it would suffice to show merely that $T(J)_* \alpha$ is nilpotent.  This is equivalent to showing that the ring spectrum $T(J) \sm R[\alpha^{-1}]$ is contractible or that the unit map is null: \[\S \to T(J) \sm R[\alpha^{-1}].\]

Pick a prime $p$ and recall the regular sequence of Landweber's theorem.  We define a spectrum $P(d+1)$ to be the regular quotient of $BP$ by $(p, v_1, \ldots, v_d)$.  A nontrivial result of Johnson and Wilson shows that if $T(J)_* X = 0$ for any $X$, then for any $d$ we have $K([0, d])_* X = 0$ and $P(d+1)_* X = 0$.\footnote{It is immediate that $T(J)_* X = 0$ forces $P(d+1)_* X = 0$ and $v_{d'}^{-1} P(d')_*(X) = 0$ for all $d' < d$.  What's nontrivial is showing that $v_{d'}^{-1} P(d')_*(X) = 0$ if and only if $K(d')_*(X) = 0$.}  Taking $X = R[\alpha^{-1}]$, have assumed all of these are zero except for $P(d+1)$.  But $\colim_d P(d+1) \simeq H\F_p \simeq K(\infty)$, and $\S \to K(\infty) \sm R[\alpha^{-1}]$ is assumed to be null as well.  By compactness of $\S$, that null-homotopy factors through some finite stage $P(d+1) \sm R[\alpha]$ with $d \gg 0$.
\end{proof}

As another example of the primacy of these methods, we can show the following interesting result.  Say that $R$ is a field spectrum when every $R$--module (in the homotopy category) splits as a wedge of suspensions of $R$.  It is easy to check (as mentioned in the proof above) that $K(d)$ is an example of such a spectrum.

\begin{theorem}
Every field spectrum $R$ splits as a wedge of Morava $K$--theories.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Set $E = \bigvee_{\text{primes $p$}} \bigvee_{d \in [0, \infty]} K(d)$, so that $E$ detects nilpotence.  The class $1$ in the field spectrum $R$ is non-nilpotent, so it survives when paired with some $K$--theory $K(d)$, and hence $R \sm K(d)$ is not contractible.  Because both $R$ and $K(d)$ are field spectra, the smash product of the two simultaneously decomposes into a wedge of $K(d)$s and a wedge of $R$s.  So, $R$ is a retract of a wedge of $K(d)$s, and picking a basis for its image on homotopy shows that it is a sub-wedge of $K(d)$s.
\end{proof}

\noindent This is interesting in its own right, because field spectra are exactly those spectra which have K\"unneth isomorphisms.  So, even if you weren't neck-deep in algebraic geometry, you might still have struck across these homology theories just if you like to compute things, since K\"unneth formulas make things computable.




\section{The periodicity theorem}

Classification of the thick subcategories

Balmer's Spc functor


Our first goal for today is to apply these local methods once more to get a positive answer to Ravenel's question about finite spectra and periodic self-maps.  The solution to this problem passes through some now-standard machinery for triangulated $\otimes$--categories.

\begin{definition}
A subcategory of the category of a triangulated category (e.g., $p$--local finite spectra) is \textit{thick} if it is closed under weak equivalences, it is closed under retracts, and it has a $2$-out-of-$3$ property for cofiber sequences.
\end{definition}

\noindent Examples of thick subcategories include:
\begin{itemize}
\item The category $\CatOf{C}_d$ of $p$--local finite spectra which are $K(d-1)$--acyclic.  (For instance, if $d = 1$, the condition of $K(0)$--acyclicity is that the spectrum have purely torsion homotopy groups.)  These are called ``finite spectra of type at least $d$''.
\item The category $\CatOf{D}_d$ of $p$--local finite spectra $F$ which have a self-map $v: \Susp^N F \to F$, $N \gg 0$, inducing multiplication by a unit in $K(d)$--homology.  These are called ``$v_d$--self--maps''.
\end{itemize}
Hopkins and Smith show the following classification theorem:

\begin{theorem}[Hopkins--Smith, easy]
Any thick subcategory $\CatOf C$ of $p$--local finite spectra must be $\CatOf C_d$ for some $d$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
It is sufficient to show that any object $X \in \CatOf C$ with $X \in \CatOf C_d$ induces an inclusion $\CatOf C_d \subseteq \CatOf C$.  Let $Y \in \CatOf C_d$ be any other spectrum of type at least $d$.  Consider the endomorphism ring spectrum $R = F(X, X)$ and the fiber $f: F \to \S$ of its unit map.\todo{Make it clear what $f$ is. Draw the fiber sequence or something.}  The action of $f$ under $K(n)$--homology is an isomorphism exactly when $X$ is $K(n)$--acyclic, and because the $K(n)$--acyclicity of $X$ implies the $K(n)$--acyclicity of $Y$, it follows that $1 \sm f: Y \sm F \to Y \sm \S$ is always null on $K(n)$--homology for all $n$.  By a small variant of the local nilpotence detection theorem, it follows that \[Y \sm F^{\sm j} \xrightarrow{1 \sm f^{\sm j}} Y \sm \S^{\sm j}\] is null for $j \gg 0$, and hence that \[\operatorname{cofib}\left( Y \sm F^{\sm j} \xrightarrow{1 \sm f^{\sm j}} Y \sm \S^{\sm j} \right) \simeq Y \sm \operatorname{cofib} f^{\sm j} \simeq Y \vee (Y \sm \Susp F^{\sm j}),\] so that $Y$ is a retract.  However, using $\operatorname{cofib}(f) = X \sm DX \in \CatOf C$ and a smash version of the octahedral axiom
\begin{align*}
F \sm F^{\sm (j-1)} & \xrightarrow{f \sm 1} \S \sm F^{\sm (j-1)} \xrightarrow{1 \sm f^{\sm (j-1)}} \S \sm \S^{\sm (j-1)} & \Rightarrow & &  F \sm \operatorname{cofib} f^{\sm (j-1)} \to \operatorname{cofib} f^{\sm j} \to \operatorname{cofib} f \sm \S^{\sm (j-1)}
\end{align*}
one can inductively show that $\operatorname{cofib}(f^{\sm j})$, hence $Y \sm \operatorname{cofib}(f^{\sm j})$, and hence $Y$ all belong to $\CatOf C$ as well.
\end{proof}

They also show the \emph{considerably} harder theorem:

\begin{theorem}[Hopkins--Smith, hard]
A $p$--local finite spectrum is $K(d-1)$--acyclic exactly when it admits a $v_d$--self--map.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}[Executive summary of proof]
Given the classification of thick subcategories, if a property is closed under thickness then one need only exhibit a single spectrum with the property to know that all the spectra in the thick subcategory it generates also all have that property.  Inductively, they manually construct finite spectra $M_0(p^{i_0}, v_1^{i_1}, \ldots, v_{d-1}^{i_{d-1}})$ for sufficiently large\footnote{Compare this asymptotic condition with the assertion yesterday that there is no root of $v: M_8(2) \to M_0(2)$.} indices $i_*$ which admit a self-map $v$ governed by a commuting square
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
BP_* M_{|v_d| i_d}(p^{i_0}, v_1^{i_1}, \ldots, v_{d-1}^{i_{d-1}}) \arrow{r}{v} \arrow[-,double]{d} & BP_* M_0(p^{i_0}, v_1^{i_1}, \ldots, v_{d-1}^{i_{d-1}}) \arrow[-,double]{d} \\
\Susp^{|v_d| i_d} BP_* / (p^{i_0}, v_1^{i_1}, \ldots, v_{d-1}^{i_{d-1}}) \arrow{r}{- \cdot v_d^{i_d}} & BP_* / (p^{i_0}, v_1^{i_1}, \ldots, v_{d-1}^{i_{d-1}}).
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
These maps are guaranteed by very careful study of Adams spectral sequences.
\end{proof}


\subsection*{Balmer spectra and chromatic localization}

As part of a broad attempt to analyze a geometric object through its modules, Paul Balmer has demonstrated the following theorem:

\begin{definition}
Given a triangulated $\otimes$--category $\CatOf C$, define a thick subcategory $\CatOf C' \subseteq \CatOf C$ to be a \textit{$\otimes$--ideal} when it has the additional property that $x \in \CatOf C'$ forces $x \otimes y \in \CatOf C'$ for any $y \in \CatOf C$.  Moreover, $\CatOf C'$ is said to be \textit{prime} when $x \otimes y \in \CatOf C'$ forces at least one of $x \in \CatOf C'$ or $y \in \CatOf C'$.  Define the \textit{spectrum} of $\CatOf C$ to be its collection of prime $\otimes$--ideals, topologized so that $U(x) = \{\CatOf C' \mid x \in \CatOf C'\}$ form a basis of opens.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Balmer]
The spectrum of $D^{\perf}(\CatOf{Mod}_R)$ is naturally homeomorphic to the Zariski spectrum of $R$.
\end{theorem}

Balmer's construction applies much more generally.  The category $\CatOf{Spectra}$ can be identified with $\CatOf{Modules}_{\S}$, and so one can attempt to compute the Balmer spectrum of $\CatOf{Modules}_{\S}^{\perf} = \CatOf{Spectra}^{\mathrm{fin}}$.  In fact, we just finished this.
\begin{theorem}
The Balmer spectrum of $\CatOf{Spectra}_{(p)}^{\mathrm{fin}}$ consists of the thick subcategories $\CatOf C_d$, and $\{\CatOf C_n\}_{n=0}^d$ are its open sets.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Using the characterization of $\CatOf C_d$ as the kernel of $K(d-1)_*$, we see that it is a prime $\otimes$--ideal: \[K(d-1)_*(X \sm Y) \cong K(d-1)_* X \otimes_{K(d-1)_*} K(d-1)_* Y\] is zero exactly when at least one of $X$ and $Y$ is $K(d-1)$--acyclic.
\end{proof}

In fact, our favorite functor\footnote{However, this functor is \emph{not} a map of triangulated categories, so this has to be interpreted lightly.} $T(J)_*: \CatOf{Spectra} \to \CatOf{QCoh}(\M_{T(J)})$ induces a homeomorphism of the Balmer spectrum of $\CatOf{Spectra}^{\mathrm{fin}}$ to that of $\moduli{fg}$.




\section{Chromatic localizations}

Proof of chromatic fracture

Calculation of $\pi_* L_{K(1)} \S$?


However, Balmer's construction gives only a topological space, and not anything like a locally ringed space (or a space otherwise equipped locally with algebraic data).\footnote{We will address this in our situation, but in general this is an open question: given a ring spectrum $R$, how can one recognize these local categories of spectra in terms of $R$, without reference to auxiliary spectra like $T(J)$?  Or, just as importantly: what makes $T(J)$ a special $\S$--algebra?}  Recalling Landweber's theorem from yesterday, Bousfield's theory of homological localization allows us to extend it as follows:

\begin{theorem}[Bousfield]
Let $R_*$ denote the homology theory associated to a flat map $j: \Spec R \to \moduli{fg}$ by Landweber's theorem.  There is then a diagram\footnote{The meat of this theorem is in overcoming set-theoretic difficulties in the construction of $\CatOf{Spectra}_R$.  Bousfield accomplished this by describing a model structure on $\CatOf{Spectra}$ for which $R$--equivalences create the weak--equivalences.}
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}[column sep=2.2cm,row sep=2cm]
\CatOf{Spectra}_R \arrow[red]{r}{R_* \quad \mathrm{conservative}} \arrow[leftarrow, shift left=0.20cm, red]{d}{L_R} & \CatOf{QCoh}(\Spec R) \arrow[shift left=0.20cm, red, leftarrow]{d}{j^*} \\
\CatOf{Spectra} \arrow[leftarrow,shift left=0.20cm, "\dashv"']{u}{i} \arrow[red]{ru}{R_*} \arrow[red]{r}{T(J)_*} & \CatOf{QCoh}(\M_{T(J)}), \arrow[leftarrow, shift left=0.20cm, "\dashv"']{u}{j_*}
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
such that $i$ is left-adjoint to $L_R$, $j^*$ is left-adjoint to $j_*$, $i$ and $j_*$ are inclusions of full subcategories, the red composites are all equal, and $R_*$ is conservative on $\CatOf{Spectra}_R$.
\end{theorem}

In the case when $R$ models the inclusion of the deformation space around the point $\Gamma_d$, we will denote the localizer by \[\CatOf{Spectra} \xrightarrow{\widehat L_d} \CatOf{Spectra}_{\Gamma_d}.\]  In the case when $R$ models the inclusion of the open complement of the unique closed substack of codimension $d$, we will denote the localizer by \[\CatOf{Spectra} \xrightarrow{L_d} \CatOf{Spectra}_d = \CatOf{Spectra}_{\moduli{fg}^{\le d}}.\]  We have set up our situation so that the following properties of these localizations either have easy proofs or are intuitive from the algebraic analogue of $j^* \vdash j_*$:
\begin{enumerate}
\item There is an equivalence \[L_d X \simeq (L_d \S) \sm X,\] analogous to $j^* M \simeq R \otimes M$ in the algebraic setting.  Because $L_{K(d)}$ is associated to the inclusion of a formal scheme (i.e., an ind-finite scheme), it has the formula \[\widehat L_d X \simeq \lim_I \left( M_0(v^I) \sm L_d X \right)\] analogous to $j^* M \simeq \lim_j (R/I^j \otimes M)$ in the complete algebraic setting.
\item Because the open substack of dimension $d$ properly contains both the open substack of dimension $(d-1)$ and the infinitesimal deformation neighborhood of the closed point of height $d$, there are natural factorizations
\begin{align*}
\operatorname{id} \to L_d \to L_{d-1}, & & \operatorname{id} \to L_d \to \widehat L_d.
\end{align*}
In particular, $L_d X = 0$ implies both $L_{d-1} X = 0$ and $\widehat L_d X = 0$.
\item The inclusion of the open substack of dimension $d-1$ into the one of dimension $d$ has relatively closed complement the point of height $d$.  Algebraically, this gives a gluing square (or Mayer-Vietoris square), and this is reflected in homotopy theory by a homotopy pullback square (the chromatic fracture square):
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
L_d \arrow{r} \arrow{d} \arrow[dr, phantom, "\lrcorner", very near start] & \widehat L_d \arrow{d} \\
L_{d-1} \arrow{r} & L_{d-1} \widehat L_d.
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
\end{enumerate}


\textbf{Chromatic dissembly}

There are also considerably more complicated facts known about these functors:
\begin{theorem}[Hopkins--Ravenel]
The homotopy limit of the tower \[\cdots \to L_d F \to L_{d-1} F \to \cdots \to L_1 F \to L_0 F\] recovers the $p$--local homotopy type of any finite spectrum $F$.\footnote{Spectra satisfying this limit property are said to be \textit{chromatically complete}, which is closely related to being \textit{harmonic}, i.e., being local with respect to $\bigvee_{d=0}^\infty K(d)$.  (I believe this a joke about ``music of the spheres''.)  It is known that nice Thom spectra (and in particular every suspension and finite spectrum) is harmonic, that every finite spectrum is chromatically complete, and that there exist some harmonic spectra which are not chromatically complete.}
\end{theorem}

\noindent This suggests a productive method for analyzing the homotopy groups of spheres: study the homotopy groups of each $L_d \S$ and perform the reassembly process encoded by this inverse limit.  Using the fracture square, one sees that it is also profitable to consider the homotopy groups of $\widehat L_d \S$.  In fact, the spectral version of $\M_E(F)$ considered on the first day furnishes us with a tool by which we can approach this:

\begin{theorem}[Bousfield, et al.]
The coskeletal filtration of $\mathcal D_E(F)$ gives a spectral sequence converging to the homotopy of its totalization, $F^\wedge_E$.\footnote{There is a subtlety here: the object $\mathcal D_E(F)$ must be able to be formed as a homotopy coherent diagram in order to produce the totalization. Essentially, this forces $E$ to be an $A_\infty$--ring spectrum. This holds for all the examples of ring spectra we have discussed.}  When $F$ is finite and $E$ models either of the cases above, this spectral sequence converges to $\pi_* L_E F$.  Furthermore, there is a line bundle $\omega$ on $\M_E$ such that\footnote{The identification of the $E_2$--page as computing stack cohomology is the first place where we really mean to employ the full technology of stacks in this talk.  Everywhere else, we have been essentially content to speak of simplicial presheaves.} \[E_2^{*, *} = H^*_{\mathrm{stack}}(\M_E; \M_E(F) \otimes \omega^{\otimes *}) \Rightarrow \pi_* L_E F.\]
\end{theorem}

The utility of this theorem is in the identification with stack cohomology.  In the case $E = E_{\Gamma_d}$, recall that $\M_{E_{\Gamma_d}}[0]$ is a smooth infinitesimal thickening of the spectrum of a field, so that \[\M_{E_{\Gamma_d}} = \left( \moduli{fg} \right)^\wedge_{\Gamma_d} \simeq \widehat{\mathbb A}^{d-1}_{\mathbb W(k)} \mmod \underline{\operatorname{Aut}}(\Gamma_d)\] as in the first example of $E = H\F_2$ on the first day.  But, in this specific case, there is an identification of stack cohomology with group cohomology: \[H^*_{\mathrm{stack}}(* \mmod \underline{G}; \mathcal M) = H^*_{\mathrm{group}}(G; M).\]  Another theorem from the arithmetic geometry literature gives \[\operatorname{Aut}(\Gamma_d) \cong \left( \mathbb{W}(k)\langle S \rangle \middle/ \left( \begin{array}{c} Sw = w^\phi S, \\ S^d = p \end{array} \right) \right)^\times,\] and so we have reduced the computation of all of the stable homotopy groups of spheres to a very difficult problem in profinite group cohomology --- but one which is arithmetically founded, so that arithmetic geometry might continue to lend a hand.

\begin{example}[Adams]
In the case $d = 1$, $\operatorname{Aut}(\Gamma_1) = \Z_p^\times$ and it acts on $\pi_* E_1 = \Z_p[u^\pm]$ by $\gamma \cdot u^n \mapsto \gamma^n u^n$.  At odd primes $p$ (so that $p$ is coprime to the torsion part of $\Z_p^\times$), one computes \[H^s(\operatorname{Aut}(\Gamma_1); \pi_* E_1) = \begin{cases}\Z_p & \text{when $s = 0$}, \\ \bigoplus_{j = 2(p-1)k} \Z_p\{u^j\} / (pk u^j) & \text{when $s = 1$}, \\ 0 & \text{otherwise}. \end{cases}\]  This, in turn, gives the calculation \[\pi_t \widehat L_1 \S^0 = \begin{cases} \Z_p & \text{when $t = 0$}, \\ \Z_p / (pk) & \text{when $t = t|v_1| - 1$}, \\ 0 & \text{otherwise}. \end{cases}\]  These groups are familiar to homotopy theorists: the $J$--homomorphism $J: BU \to BF$ described on the first day selects exactly these elements (for nonnegative $t$).
\end{example}

Generally: if $X$ is a space, then $X_{H\F_2}$ is a scheme with an $\Aut \widehat \G_a$--action. If $X$ is a spectrum (so it fails to have a diagonal map) then $(H\F_2)_* X$ is just an $\F_2$--module, also with an $\Aut \widehat \G_a$--action.

The cohomology of a qc sheaf pushed forward from a scheme to a stack along a cover agrees with just the cohomology over the scheme. (In the case of $* \to * \mmod G$, this probably uses the cospan $* \to * \mmod G \leftarrow *$ with pullback $G$...)

Akhil Mathew has notes from an algebraic geometry class ( https://math.berkeley.edu/{\textasciitilde}amathew/232b.pdf ) where lectures 3--5 address the theorem of the cube.

Equivalences of various sorts of cohomologies: Ext in modules and quasicoherent cohomology (goodness. Hartshorne, I suppose); Ext in comodules and quasicoherent cohomology on stacks (COCTALOS Lemma 12.4); quasicoherent cohomology on simplicial schemes (Stacks project 09VK).

using the splitting principle to describe $\Div^+_n \CP^\infty_E = BU(n)_E$, and in particular that projectivization theorem. This is in the proof of 16.2 in Switzer, though he doesn't state it as one of the consequences in the theorem text itself. The main point is that the fiber map $\CP^{n-1} \to P(V) \to X$ postcomposes by $P(V) \to \CP^\infty$ to the skeletal inclusion, so the Serre spectral sequence degenerates since its fiber is unmolested (or: the Leray--Hirsch theorem). The Chern classes are \emph{defined} by the one remaining multiplicative extension.

character sheaves, $\moduli{fg}$ versus $\moduli{fg}^{(1)}$, graded versus ungraded things. this is explored in some detail around Remark 3.14 and formula (3.4) in Paul's notes on $\CatOf{QCoh}(\moduli{fg})$.

A proof of Quillen's theorem appears in II.8 in Adams's blue book. This actually looks like some of it is amenable to attack under the formal group theoretic perspective? Doing this ``right'' would be tricky: there are odd--dimensional phenomena, and the Bockstein actually matters. Still, a thought.

Make clear the distinction between $E_n$ and $\widehat{E(n)}$. Maybe explain the Devinatz--Hopkins remark that $r: \widehat{E(n)} \to E_n$ is an inclusion of fixed points and as such does not classify the versal formal group law.

Mike says that in unpublished AHS work they got at $MString^E$ using an equivalence $M\String \simeq MU[6, \infty) \sm_{\Susp^\infty_+ \Spin/SU} \S$ and a collapsing $\Tor$ spectral sequence.
