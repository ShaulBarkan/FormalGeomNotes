\textbf{Class information}

\vspace{2\baselineskip} \noindent \textit{Meeting times: }
Spring 2016, MWF 12pm--1pm.

\vspace{2\baselineskip} \noindent \textit{Goals: }
The primary goal of this class is to teach students to view results in algebraic topology through the lens of (formal) algebraic geometry.

\vspace{2\baselineskip} \noindent \textit{Grading: }
This class won't have any official assignments. I'll give references as readings for those who would like a deeper understanding, though I'll do my best to ensure that no extra reading is required to follow the arc of the class.

I do want to assemble course notes from this class, but it's unlikely that I will have time to type \emph{all} of them up. Instead, I would like to ``crowdsource'' this somewhat: I'll type up skeletal notes for each lecture, and then we as a class will try to flesh them out as the semester progresses. As incentive to help, those who contribute to the document will have their name included in the acknowledgements, and those who contribute \emph{substantially} will have their name added as a coauthor. Everyone could use more CV items.

\section{Jan 25}

The goal of this class is to communicate a certain \textit{weltanschauung} uncovered in pieces by many different people working in bordism theory, and the goal just for today is to tell a story about one theorem where it is especially apparent.

To begin, recall that a bordism theory $MX$, where $X$ is some suitable family of structure groups $X_n \to O(n)$, is a homology theory similar to singular homology but where the chains are constructed from $X$--structured manifolds and their boundaries.  The coefficient ring of $MX$, or its value $MX_*(*)$ on a point, gives the ring of $X$--bordism classes, and generally $MX_*(Y)$ of some space $Y$ gives a kind of ``bordism in families''.  There are evident comparison morphisms for the most ordinary kinds of bordism, given by replacing a chain of manifolds with an equivalent simplicial chain: \[MO \to H\Z/2, \quad MSO \to H\Z.\] In both cases, we can evaluate on a point to get ring maps $MO_*(*) \to \Z/2$ and $MSO_*(*) \to \Z$, called ``genera'' --- neither of which is very interesting, since they're both zero in positive degrees.\todo{A comparison of this with the usual spectrum definition of $MX$ appears in Switzer 12.35.}

However, having maps of homology theories (rather than just maps of coefficient rings) is considerably more data: we can extact from this a theory of integration.  Consider the following:
\begin{align*}
MSO_n K(\Z, n) & = \left\{ \text{oriented $n$--manifolds mapping to $K(\Z, n)$} \right\} / \sim \\
& = \left\{ \begin{array}{c}\text{oriented $n$--manifolds $M$} \\ \text{with a specified class $\omega \in H^n(M; \Z)$} \end{array}\right\} / \sim.
\end{align*}
The yoga of stable homotopy theory then allows us to build a composite \[\S^0 \xrightarrow{(M, \omega)} MSO \sm (\S^{-n} \sm \Susp^\infty_+ K(\Z, n)) \to MSO \sm H\Z \xrightarrow{\phi \sm 1} H\Z \sm H\Z \xrightarrow\mu H\Z,\] where $\phi$ is the orientation map, and this gives us an integer. This integer is $\int_M \omega$, and it comes equipped with a Stokes' theorem due to the relation ``$\sim$'', and we can begin to see what the techniques of stable homotopy theory have to offer.

Now take $X = e$ to be the trivial structure group, so that the Pontryagin--Thom construction gives an equivalence $Me \xrightarrow{\simeq} \S$.  It is thus possible (and some people have indeed taken up this viewpoint) that stable homotopy theory can be done solely through the lens of ``framed bordism''. I'm a stable homotopy theorist rather than a differential topologist, and so I prefer to view this the other way: the sphere spectrum $\S$ often appears in my life as a natural object, and I will sometimes replace it by $Me$, the framed bordism spectrum.  For example, often I encounter a ring spectrum $E$, and it comes equipped with a unit map $\S \to E$, which I can reconsider as a ring map $\S = Me \to E$.  Following along the lines of the previous paragraph, we learn that we can thus think of any ring spectrum $E$ as automatically equipped with a theory of integration for framed manifolds.

Sometimes, as in the examples above, this unit map factors: \[\S = Me \to MO \to H\Z/2.\]  This is a witness to the overdeterminacy of $H\Z/2$'s integral for framed bordism: if the framed manifold is pushed all the way down to an unoriented manifold, there is still enough residual data to define the integral.  For a generic ring spectrum $E$, we can ask the analogous question: for a Hausdorff filtration on $O$ by structure groups, what stage does the unit map $Me \to E$ factor through?  The map $SO \to O$ considered above is the beginning of the Postnikov filtration of $O$, and we include a diagram of this filtration and some interesting integration theories related to it:
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
Me \arrow{r} \arrow{rrd} \arrow{rrrd} \arrow{rrrrd} & \cdots \arrow{r} & M\Spin \arrow{r} \arrow[crossing over]{d} & MSO \arrow{r} \arrow[crossing over]{d} & MO \arrow[crossing over]{d} \\
& & ko & H\Z & H\Z/2.
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}

This is the situation homotopy theorists found themselves in some decades ago, in the wake of two important results of Ochanine and Witten. Ochanine had proven the following mysterious theorem using analytic techniques:

\begin{theorem}[Ochanine]
There is a cobordism invariant $o(M)$ of an oriented manifold $M$ which is a level $2$ modular form. It is somewhat multiplicative: if $F \to E \to M$ is an exceedingly nice fibration, then $o(E) = o(F) \cdot o(M)$.
\end{theorem}

\noindent Witten then strengthened this result considerably:

\begin{theorem}[Witten]
Ochanine's genus is in fact multiplicative. Also, if $M$ is a Spin manifold such that twice its first Pontryagin class vanishes, then $o(M)$ can be ``refined''\todo{What does ``refined'' mean, anyway? It's a square root, maybe?} to a level $1$ modular form $w(M)$.
\end{theorem}

\noindent However, neither party gave indication that their result should be valid ``in families'', and no theory of integration was produced.  It wasn't even clear what such a claim would mean: to give a topological enrichment of these theorems would mean finding a ring spectrum $E$ such that $E_*(*)$ had something to do with modular forms.  Around the same time, Landweber, Ravenel, and Stong began studying ``elliptic cohomology'' for independent reasons, and a decade later Ando, Hopkins, and Strickland put them together in the following theorem:

\begin{theorem}[Ando--Hopkins--Strickland]
If $E$ is an ``elliptic cohomology theory'', then there is a canonical map $M\String \to E$ called the $\sigma$--orientation.  Specializing to Tate $K$--theory $K^{\Tate}$, the induced map $M\String_* \to K^{\Tate}_*$ is Witten's genus.
\end{theorem}

We now come to the motivation for this class.  The homotopical $\sigma$--orientation was actually first constructed using formal geometry.  The original proof of Ando--Hopkins--Strickland begins with a reduction to understanding maps \[MU[6, \infty) \to E,\] and then they work to show that they can complete the missing arrow in the diagram
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
MU[6, \infty) \arrow{r} \arrow{rd} & M\String \arrow[densely dotted]{d} \\
& E.
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
Leaving aside the extension problem for the moment, their main theorem is the following description of the cohomology ring $E^* MU[6, \infty)$:
\begin{theorem}[Ando--Hopkins--Strickland]
For $E$ an even--periodic cohomology theory, \[\Spec E_* MU[6, \infty) \cong C^3(\G_E; \sheaf I(0)),\] where ``$C^3(\G_E; \sheaf I(0))$'' is a certain scheme.  When $E$ is taken to be elliptic, so that there is a specified isomorphism $\G_E \cong C^\wedge_0$ for $C$ an elliptic curve, this furnishes the scheme with a canonical point. Hence, there is a preferred class $MU[6, \infty) \to E$, natural in the choice of elliptic $E$.
\end{theorem}

\noindent Our real goal is to understand theorems like these.  The structure of the class will be, more or less, to work through a sequence of case studies where this perspective on algebraic topology shines through most brightly.  We'll start by working through Thom's calculation of the homotopy of $MO$, which simultaneously holds the attractive features of being free of technical complexity while revealing essentially all of the structural complexity.  Having seen that through to the end, we'll then work on reinforcing our technical underpinnings, and then we'll venture on to other examples.  The overriding theme of the class will be that this is a good organizing principle that gives us one avenue of insight into how homotopy theory functions. 




\section{Jan 27}

Our first case study is a sequence of theorems about the unoriented bordism spectrum $MO$.  I wanted to begin by recalling one definition of the spectrum $MO$, since it will be useful to us throughout the semester.

\begin{definition}
For a spherical bundle $S^{n-1} \to \xi \to X$, its Thom space is given by the cofiber \[\xi \to X \xrightarrow{\text{cofiber}} T(\xi).\]
\end{definition}
\begin{proof}[``Proof'' of definition]
There's a more usual construction of the Thom space too: the associated disk bundle by gluing an $n$--disk in fiberwise, then taking the one--point compactification: \[T(\xi) = (\xi \sqcup'_{S^{n-1}} D^n)^+.\] How does this compare? Well, the thickening of $\xi$ is an $n$--disk bundle is the same thing as taking the mapping cylinder on $\xi \to X$. Since the inclusion into the mapping cylinder is now a cofibration, the quotient by this subspace agrees with both the cofiber of the map and the one--point compactification.
\end{proof}

Before proceeding, here are two important examples:
\begin{example}\label{TrivialBundleThomExample}
If $\xi = S^{n-1} \times X$ is the trivial bundle, then $T(\xi) = S^n \sm (X_+)$.  This is supposed to indicate what Thom spaces are ``doing'': if you feed in the trivial bundle then you get the suspension out, so if you feed in a twisted bundle you should think of it as a \textit{twisted suspension}.
\end{example}

\begin{example}
Let $\xi$ be the tautological $S^0$--bundle over $\RP^\infty = BO(1)$.  Because $\xi$ has contractible total space, the cofiber degenerates and it follows that $T(\xi) = \RP^\infty$. More generally, arguing by cells shows that the Thom space for the tautological bundle over $\RP^n$ is $\RP^{n+1}$.
\end{example}

Now we catalog a bunch of useful properties of the Thom space functor. Firstly, recall that a spherical bundle over $X$ is the same data as a map $X \to B \GL_1 S^{n-1}$, where $\GL_1 S^{n-1}$ is the subspace of $F(S^{n-1}, S^{n-1})$ expressed by the pullback
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
\GL_1 S^{n-1} \arrow{r} \arrow{d} & F(S^{n-1}, S^{n-1}) \arrow{d} \\
\Aut_{h\CatOf{Spaces}} S^{n-1} \arrow{r} & \End_{h\CatOf{Spaces}} S^{n-1} \arrow[-,double]{r} & \pi_0 F(S^{n-1}, S^{n-1}).
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
We can interpret $T$ as a functor from the slice category over $BGL_1 S^{n-1}$ to $\CatOf{Spaces}$: maps \[Y \xrightarrow{f} X \xrightarrow{\xi} B \GL_1 S^{n-1}\] induce maps $T(f^* \xi) \to T(\xi)$, and $T$ is suitably homotopy-invariant.

Next, a common source of spherical bundles is taking the spherical subbundle of a vector bundle.  Since rank $n$ vector bundles are also classified by an object $BO(n)$, this begets a map $J_{\R}^n: BO(n) \to B \GL_1 S^{n-1}$ for each $n$.  Homotopy theorists are very interested in the block--inclusion maps $i^n: BO(n) \to BO(n+1)$ and the colimit $BO = BO(\infty)$.  The suspension functor induces a map $\GL_1 S^{n-1} \to \GL_1 S^n$, and we are led to ask about the compatibility of these operations.  As a route to answering this, the block--inclusion maps are a special case of a more general direct sum map $\oplus: BO(n) \times BO(m) \to BO(n+m)$, given by the precomposition \[BO(n) = BO(n) \times * \xrightarrow{\operatorname{id} \times \text{triv}} BO(n) \times BO(1) \xrightarrow\oplus BO(n+1).\] The spaces $B \GL_1 S^{n-1}$ enjoy a similar ``collective monoid'' structure, given by taking the fiberwise join two spherical bundles with a common base.
\begin{lemma}
The fiberwise join is represented by maps \[B\GL_1 S^{n-1} \times B\GL_1 S^{m-1} \to B\GL_1 S^{n+m-1},\] and these maps commute with the block sum maps on the $BO(n)$ family. \qed
\end{lemma}
\noindent Again taking a cue from $K$--theory, we take the colimit as $n$ grows large.
\begin{corollary}
There is a map of $H$--spaces $J_{\R}: BO \to B\GL_1 \S$ called the \textit{stable $J$--homomorphism}. \qed
\end{corollary}
\noindent Finally, we can ask about the compatibility of $T$ with all of this:
\begin{lemma}
$T$ is monoidal: it carries fiberwise joins to smash products of spaces. \qed
\end{lemma}

We are now prepared to define our spectrum $MO$.  The unstable $J$--maps $J_{\R}^n: BO(n) \to B\GL_1 S^{n-1}$ give Thom spaces $T(J_{\R}^n)$,\todo{Be careful about dimension here: you really mean a reduced tautological bundle, related to how $BO$ has only one connected component.} equipped with maps\todo{Fix this equation.} \[\Susp T(J_{\R}^n) = T(J_{\R}^n \oplus \text{triv}) \to T(J_{\R}^{n+1}).\] Setting $MO(n) = \Susp^{-n} \Susp^\infty T(J_{\R}^n)$, we again assemble this data into a single object: \[MO := \colim_n MO(n) = \colim_n \Susp^{-n} T(J_{\R}^n).\]

The spectrum $MO$ has several remarkable properties.  The most basic such property is that it is a ring spectrum, and this follows immediately from $J_{\R}$ being a homomorphism of $H$--spaces.  Much more excitingly, we can also deduce the presence of Thom isomorphisms just from the properties stated thus far.  That $J_{\R}$ is a homomorphism means that the following square commutes:
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
BO \times BO \arrow{r}{\sigma, \simeq} \arrow[bend right]{rrd} & BO \times BO \arrow{r}{\mu} \arrow{d}{J_{\R} \times J_{\R}} & BO \arrow{d}{J_{\R}} \\
& B\GL_1 \S \times B\GL_1 \S \arrow{r}{\mu} & B\GL_1 \S.
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
We have extended this square very slightly by a certain shearing map $\sigma$ defined by $\sigma(x, y) = (xy^{-1}, y)$.\todo{$\sigma$ \emph{almost} shows up in giving a categorical definition of a $G$--torsor.  I wish I understood this, but I always get tangled up.}  It's evident that $\sigma$ is a homotopy equivalence, since just as we can de-scale the first coordinate by $y$ we can re-scale by it.  We can calculate directly the behavior of the long composite: \[J_{\R} \circ \mu \circ \sigma(x, y) = J_{\R} \circ \mu(xy^{-1}, y) = J_{\R}(xy^{-1}y) = J_{\R}(x).\]  It follows that the second coordinate plays no role, and that the bundle classified by the long composite can be written as $J_{\R} \times 0$.\footnote{This factorization does \emph{not} commute with the rest of the diagram, just with the little triangle it forms.}  We are now in a position to see the Thom isomorphism:
\begin{lemma}[Thom isomorphism, universal example] $MO \sm MO \simeq MO \sm \Susp^\infty_+ BO$.\todo{Is it clear that this is an equivalence of $MO$--modules? This should come from the $x$--factor being unmolested, right?}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Stringing together the naturality properties of the Thom functor outlined above, we can thus make the following calculation:\todo{This Q.E.D.\ block isn't typeset well.}
\begin{align*}
T(\mu \circ (J_{\R} \times J_{\R})) & \simeq T(\mu \circ (J_{\R} \times J_{\R}) \circ \sigma) & \text{(homotopy invariance)} \\
& \simeq T(\mu \circ (J_{\R} \times 0)) & \text{(constructed lift)} \\
& \simeq T(J_{\R}) \sm T(0) & \text{(monoidality)} \\
& \simeq MO \sm \Susp^\infty_+ BO & \text{(definition of $MO$, \Cref{TrivialBundleThomExample})} \\
T(J_{\R}) \sm T(J_{\R}) & \simeq MO \sm \Susp^\infty_+ BO & \text{(monoidality)} \\
MO \sm MO & \simeq MO \sm \Susp^\infty_+ BO. & \text{(definition of $MO$) \qedhere}
\end{align*}
\end{proof}

From here, the general version of Thom's theorem follows quickly:
\begin{theorem}[Thom isomorphism]
Let $\xi: X \to BO$ classify a vector bundle and let $\phi: MO \to E$ be a map of ring spectra. Then there is an equivalence of $E$--modules \[E \sm T(\xi) \simeq E \sm \Susp^\infty_+ X.\]
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}[Modifications to above proof]
To accommodate $X$ rather than $BO$ as the base, we redefine $\sigma: BO \times X \to BO \times X$ by \[\sigma(x, y) = \sigma(x \xi(y)^{-1}, y).\]  This gives an equivalence $MO \sm T(\xi) \simeq MO \sm \Susp^\infty_+ X$.  To introduce $E$, note that there is a diagram
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
E \sm T(\xi) \arrow[densely dotted]{r}{\simeq} \arrow{d}{\eta_{MO} \sm \id \sm \id} & E \sm \Susp^\infty_+ X \arrow{d}{\eta_{MO} \sm \id \sm \id} \\
MO \sm E \sm T(\xi) \arrow{r}{\simeq} \arrow{d}{(\mu \circ (\phi \sm \id)) \sm \id} & MO \sm E \sm \Susp^\infty_+ X \arrow{d}{(\mu \circ (\phi \sm \id)) \sm \id} \\
E \sm T(\xi) \arrow{r} & E \sm \Susp^\infty_+ X.
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
The middle equivalence comes from the previous Thom isomorphism, smashed through with $E$.  The bottom arrow exists by applying the action map to both sides.  Reusing the bottom arrow at the top arrow and using the unitality of the monoid $E$ shows the map to be an equivalence.
\end{proof}






calculation of $H\F_2^* BO(1)$ and $H\F_2^* MO(1)$ using the module-theoretic part of the Thom isomorphism





\section{Jan 29}

Our overriding theme for this semester is to put ``Spec'' in front of things in algebraic topology and see what happens.

What we mean by an affine scheme: the functor of points.

The schemes $\RP^n_{H\F_2}$, the group structure on $\RP^\infty_{H\F_2}$

The Steenrod algebra: Milnor's theorem that (1) the operations are all visible in $\RP^\infty_{H\F_2}$, (2) the cooperations are polynomial, and (3) formulas for the diagonal and conjugate

Generally: if $X$ is a space, then $X_{H\F_2}$ is a scheme with an $\Aut \widehat \G_a$--action. If $X$ is a spectrum (so it fails to have a diagonal map) then $(H\F_2)_* X$ is just an $\F_2$--module, also with an $\Aut \widehat \G_a$--action.

Make a point that you mean $\Aut \widehat \G_a$ and not $\Aut \G_a$.

\section{Feb 3}

the splitting principle

$MO$--orientations agree with factorizations of the unit through $MO(1)$

identification of $MO^{H\F_2}$ with $\Coord(\RP^\infty_{H\F_2})$

Hood made the following nice observation. $MO^{H\F_2}$ is the scheme of coordinates on $\RP^\infty_{H\F_2}$, with coordinate ring $\F_2[x_1, x_2, \ldots]$ and corresponding series $f(t) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty x_{n-1} t^n$ and $x_0 = 1$ implicit. This identification is equivalent to Adams's observation that $MO$ is the ``free homotopy ring spectrum'' on $MO(1)$ his sense. Then, $\Spec \mathcal{A}_* = \underline{\operatorname{Aut}}(\widehat{\G}_a)$ acts on this by coordinate changes (and we can pick a left-- or right--action as we see fit). If we pick an action by postcomposition, then we can do the following nice thing: set $f(t) = f_2(t) + g(t)$, where $f_2(t)$ contains just the terms in degrees perfect powers of $2$. Then $f_2^{-1}(f(t))$ is another coordinate with no terms in degrees perfect powers of $2$, and any nontrivial automorphism applied to this ``reduced'' series will re-introduce terms in degrees perfect powers of $2$.  So, this is a canonical form for the series under the $\underline{\operatorname{Aut}}(\widehat{\mathbb G}_a)$--action which admits no further automorphisms. It should follow that $H^*(\context{H\F_2}; \context{H\F_2}(MO))$ has amplitude $0$ and takes the form $\F_2[x_j \mid j \ne 2^n - 1]$, i.e., whose generating function is arbitrary other than having no terms in degrees perfect powers of $2$.

This means that the Adams spectral sequence degenerates and this computes $\pi_* MO$.  (It would be nice to interpret this in terms of a logarithm on $\RP^\infty_{H\F_2}$.)  It also means that the Hurewicz map is injective, hence that $MO$ is a retract of $H\F_2 \sm MO$, hence that $MO$ is an $H\F_2$--module, hence that $MO$ is a wedge of shifts of $H\F_2$.










\section{Material for lecture}








The cohomology of a qc sheaf pushed forward from a scheme to a stack along a cover agrees with just the cohomology over the scheme. (In the case of $* \to * \mmod G$, this probably uses the cospan $* \to * \mmod G \leftarrow *$ with pullback $G$...)

Akhil Mathew has notes from an algebraic geometry class ( https://math.berkeley.edu/{\textasciitilde}amathew/232b.pdf ) where lectures 3--5 address the theorem of the cube.

Equivalences of various sorts of cohomologies: Ext in modules and quasicoherent cohomology (goodness. Hartshorne, I suppose); Ext in comodules and quasicoherent cohomology on stacks (COCTALOS Lemma 12.4); quasicoherent cohomology on simplicial schemes (Stacks project 09VK).

using the splitting principle to describe $\Div^+_n \CP^\infty_E = BU(n)_E$, and in particular that projectivization theorem. This is in the proof of 16.2 in Switzer, though he doesn't state it as one of the consequences in the theorem text itself. The main point is that the fiber map $\CP^{n-1} \to P(V) \to X$ postcomposes by $P(V) \to \CP^\infty$ to the skeletal inclusion, so the Serre spectral sequence degenerates since its fiber is unmolested (or: the Leray--Hirsch theorem). The Chern classes are \emph{defined} by the one remaining multiplicative extension.

character sheaves, $\moduli{fg}$ versus $\moduli{fg}^{(1)}$, graded versus ungraded things. this is explored in some detail around Remark 3.14 and formula (3.4) in Paul's notes on $\CatOf{QCoh}(\moduli{fg})$.

A proof of Quillen's theorem appears in II.8 in Adams's blue book. This actually looks like some of it is amenable to attack under the formal group theoretic perspective? Doing this ``right'' would be tricky: there are odd--dimensional phenomena, and the Bockstein actually matters. Still, a thought.

Make clear the distinction between $E_n$ and $\widehat{E(n)}$. Maybe explain the Devinatz--Hopkins remark that $r: \widehat{E(n)} \to E_n$ is an inclusion of fixed points and as such does not classify the versal formal group law.

\item Overview of the class. (Orientations and theories of integration. Statement of the $\sigma$--orientation.)

\textsc{Case study: mod--$2$ homology}
\item Sheaves and formal schemes. The Steenrod algebra and $\context{H\F_2}$.
\item The mod--$2$ Adams spectral sequence. Sheaf cohomology. 
\item The sheaf $\context{H\F_2}(MO)$ and $\pi_* MO$.

\textsc{Introduction to the chromatic program}

\item Neil's $X_E$ construction for a general $E$. Formal schemes and formal groups. Basic theorems on formal varieties.
\item Simplicial presheaves, definition of the context. Homological and cohomological versions. Thom isomorphisms, and Quillen's theorem on $\context{\MU}$.
\item Structure theorems on $\moduli{fg}$. The picture. The definition of $K$-- and $E$--theories.
\item Group schemes and Hopf algebras. Finite dimensional Hopf algebras form an abelian category. Dieudonn\'e theory.
\item The periodicity and thick subcategory theorems. Bousfield localization, chromatic localizations and their properties, chromatic convergence.
\item $E(1)$--local homotopy of the sphere.

\textsc{The $\sigma$--orientation}

\item Thom spectra, line bundles, and divisors
\item The nonrigid, complex $\sigma$--orientation
\item Cohomological versions of AHS: $BU[2k, \infty)_E$.
\item The real version of the $\sigma$--orientation: $B\String_E$
\item Singer--Stong calculation of $H^* BU[2k, \infty)$. [ASIDE: $H\F_2^* ko$ and the Hopf algebra quotient of $\A_*$.]

\textsc{Power operations}

\item Ando, Hopkins, Strickland on $H_\infty$--orientations and the norm condition
\item The rigid, real $\sigma$--orientation: AHR. Its effect in homology.
\item The Rezk logarithm and the Bousfield--Kuhn functor
\item Statement of Lurie's characterization of $\TMF$, using this to determine a map from $M\String$ by AHR
\item Dylan's paper on String orientations
