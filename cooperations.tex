\chapter{Unstable cooperations}

\todo{Write an introduction for me.}





\todo[inline]{This section can probably be introduced as trying to enrich the notion of a context for cohomology theories swallowing \emph{spaces}.  The stable cooperations are totally captured by the notion of a context, but there are two approaches to (distinct sorts of) unstable operations: Hopf rings and power operations.  We plan on talking about both (and they both have something to say about $MU\<6\>$), so this can be a common thread.}




\section{Unstable contexts}

\todo[inline]{I would like to construct a framework that these things live in, like simplicial schemes gave a framework for stable contexts.  At first glance, though, I'm not sure what to do / whether this is possible.  My best guess for now is some arboreal thing, where $E_* \OS{F}{*}$ plays the role of an operadic right-module and $E_* \OS{E}{*}$ governs the internal structure of the tree.  This doesn't seem quite right, though, and I'm already getting sick of thinking about it.}

Let $E$ be a ring spectrum with constituent spaces $\OS{E}{*}$ in its $\Omega$--spectrum.  Then for a space $X$ we define the space \[E(X) = \colim_{j \to \infty} \Loops^j (\OS{E}{j} \sm X) = \Loops^\infty (E \sm \Susp^\infty X)\] which has the property $\pi_* E(X) = \widetilde E_* X$.  This construction defines a functor with two evident natural transformations:\todo{Sort out this question mark.}
\begin{align*}
\eta \co X & \simeq S^0 \sm X \\
& \to \OS{E}{0} \sm X \\
& \to \colim_{j \to \infty} \Loops^j(\OS{E}{j} \sm X) \simeq E(X), \\
\\
\mu \co E(E(X)) & = \colim_{j \to \infty} \Loops^j \left( \OS{E}{j} \sm \colim_{k \to \infty} \Loops^k (\OS{E}{k} \sm X) \right) \\
& \xrightarrow{\simeq?} \colim_{\substack{j \to \infty \\ k \to \infty}} \Loops^{j+k} (\OS{E}{j} \sm \OS{E}{k} \sm X) \\
& \xrightarrow{\mu} \colim_{\substack{j \to \infty \\ k \to \infty}} \Loops^{j+k} (\OS{E}{j+k} \sm X) \xleftarrow{\simeq} E(X).
\end{align*}

\begin{definition}
Using these maps, we can construct the following cosimplicial space, the unstable analogue of the descent object from \Cref{StableContextLecture}:
\[\sheaf{UD}_E(X) := \left\{
\begin{tikzcd}
\begin{array}{c} E \\ \circ \\ X \end{array} \arrow[leftarrow, shift left=\baselineskip]{r}{\mu} \arrow[shift left=(2*\baselineskip)]{r}{\eta_L} \arrow{r}{\eta_R} &
\begin{array}{c} E \\ \circ \\ E \\ \circ \\ X \end{array} \arrow[shift left=(3*\baselineskip)]{r} \arrow[leftarrow, shift left=(2*\baselineskip)]{r} \arrow[shift left=\baselineskip]{r}{\Delta} \arrow[leftarrow]{r} \arrow[shift right=\baselineskip]{r} &
\begin{array}{c} E \\ \circ \\ E \\ \circ \\ E \\ \circ \\ X \end{array} \arrow[shift left=(4*\baselineskip)]{r} \arrow[leftarrow, shift left=(3*\baselineskip)]{r} \arrow[shift left=(2*\baselineskip)]{r} \arrow[leftarrow, shift left=\baselineskip]{r} \arrow{r} \arrow[leftarrow, shift right=\baselineskip]{r} \arrow[shift right=(2*\baselineskip)]{r} &
\cdots
\end{tikzcd}
\right\}.\]
Its totalization gives the \textit{unstable $E$--completion of $X$}.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
Under suitable hypotheses, we extract from this an \textit{unstable context for $E$}:
\begin{align*}
\mathcal{UM}_E & := \Spec \pi_* \sheaf{UD}_E(S^0) \\
& = \left\{
\begin{tikzcd}[ampersand replacement=\&]
\Spec \pi_* E \arrow{r} \arrow[leftarrow,shift left=\baselineskip]{r}
\arrow[leftarrow,shift right=\baselineskip]{r}
\&
\Spec \pi_* \left( \begin{array}{c} E \\ \circ \\ E \end{array} \right)
\arrow[leftarrow, shift left=(2*\baselineskip)]{r} \arrow[shift left=\baselineskip]{r} \arrow[leftarrow]{r} \arrow[shift right=\baselineskip]{r} \arrow[leftarrow, shift right=(2*\baselineskip)]{r}
\&
\cdots
\end{tikzcd}
\right\}
\end{align*}
as well as a quasicoherent sheaf over it associated to $X$:
\begin{align*}
\sheaf{UM}_E(X) & := \left(\pi_* \sheaf{UD}_E(X)\right){\widetilde{}} \\
& = \left\{
\begin{tikzcd}[ampersand replacement=\&]
\pi_* \left( \begin{array}{c} E \\ \circ \\ X \end{array} \right)\widetilde{} \arrow[leftarrow, shift left=\baselineskip]{r} \arrow[shift left=(2*\baselineskip)]{r} \arrow{r} \&
\pi_* \left( \begin{array}{c} E \\ \circ \\ E \\ \circ \\ X \end{array} \right)\widetilde{} \arrow[shift left=(3*\baselineskip)]{r} \arrow[leftarrow, shift left=(2*\baselineskip)]{r} \arrow[shift left=\baselineskip]{r} \arrow[leftarrow]{r} \arrow[shift right=\baselineskip]{r} \&
\pi_* \left( \begin{array}{c} E \\ \circ \\ E \\ \circ \\ E \\ \circ \\ X \end{array} \right)\widetilde{} \arrow[shift left=(4*\baselineskip)]{r} \arrow[leftarrow, shift left=(3*\baselineskip)]{r} \arrow[shift left=(2*\baselineskip)]{r} \arrow[leftarrow, shift left=\baselineskip]{r} \arrow{r} \arrow[leftarrow, shift right=\baselineskip]{r} \arrow[shift right=(2*\baselineskip)]{r} \&
\cdots
\end{tikzcd}
\right\}.
\end{align*}
\end{definition}

say when this thing has good convergence properties to $\pi_* X$ (cf. Section 3 of BCM)

say when this thing has an identifiable $E_2$ term (cf. the end of Section 6 of BCM in particular)

------------




Hopf rings: algebraic and topological

\begin{definition}\todo{Can this definition be made without specifying the grading as such and instead using a $\G_m$--action?}
A Hopf ring $A_{*, *}$ over a graded ring $R_*$ is itself a graded ring object in the category $\CatOf{Coalgebras}_{R_*}$, sometimes called an $R_*$--coalgebraic graded ring object.  It has the following structure maps:
\begin{align*}
+ & \co A_{s, t} \times A_{s, t} \to A_{s, t} & \text{($A_{s, t}$ is an abelian group)} \\
\cdot & \co R_{s'} \otimes_{R_*} A_{s, t} \to A_{s+s', t} & \text{($A_{*, t}$ is a $R_*$--module)} \\
\Delta & \co A_{s, t} \to \bigoplus_{s' + s'' = s} A_{s', t} \otimes_{R_*} A_{s'', t} & \text{($A_{*, t}$ is a $R_*$--coalgebra)} \\
\ast & \co A_{s, t} \otimes_{R_*} A_{s', t} \to A_{s + s', t} & \text{(addition for the ring in $R_*$--coalgebras)} \\
\eta_\ast & \co R_* \to A_{*, 0} & \text{(null element for ring addition)} \\
\chi & \co A_{s, t} \to A_{s, t} & \text{(negation for the ring in $R_*$--coalgebras)} \\
\circ & \co A_{s, t} \otimes_{R_*} A_{s', t'} \to A_{s + s', t + t'} & \text{(multiplication map for the ring in $R_*$--coalgebras)} \\
\eta_\circ & \co R_* \to A_{*, 0} & \text{(null element for ring multiplication)}.
\end{align*}
These are required to satisfy various commutative diagrams. The least obvious is displayed in \Cref{DistributivityDiagram}, encoding the distributivity of $\circ$--``multiplication'' over $\ast$--``addition''.
\end{definition}

\end{tikzcd}

The context of additive unstable cooperations: make the module of $\ast$--indecomposables $QE_* \Susp^{-*} \OS{E}{*}$ into an algebra using the $\circ$--product, noting that it descends to a map \[QE_* \Susp^{-n} \OS{E}{n} \otimes QE_* \Susp^{-m} \OS{E}{m} \to QE_* \Susp^{-(n+m)} \OS{E}{n+m}.\]  The cooperations that survive to the $\ast$--indecomposables are exactly the additive ones.

The context of all unstable cooperations: don't pass to the indecomposable quotient.  This is pretty complicated.

Unbalanced unstable cooperations and Morita functors: I feel that given an unstable $E^*$--comodule $M$, one can produce an unstable $F^*$--comodule by a tensoring operation: $M \otimes_? F_* \OS{E}{*}$ (or something?).  If $M$ is actually $M = E^* X$ for a space $X$, then there should be a comparison map \[F^* X \to E^* X \otimes_? F_* \OS{E}{*}.\]  This will rarely be an isomorphism, but it should fit into the sheaf-over-a-simplicial-scheme picture as something like a face map.

Associated Adams spectral sequences and completions?

Comparison with past scholia on ``piles''?

\citeme{Bendersky Curtis Miller's~\cite{BCM} \textit{The unstable Adams spectral sequence for generalized homology}}
\citeme{Boardman Johnson Wilson's \textit{Unstable operations in generalized cohomology}}

Goerss mentions inverting the suspension element as being the same as stabilizing. This is a nice picture. Cf.\ Example 10.5 of Goerss's \textit{Hopf rings, Dieudonn\'e modules, and $E_* \Loops^2 S^3$}.

Lukas's main suggestion was to consider how the shriek functors were computed in excellent cases, so that maybe the push-pull formula could be directly interpreted on the level of spectra.  I think this is a good thing to think about.  Maybe it will tell us how ``handed'' Hopf rings appear in isolation, without their chirally dual mate.

Talk about how $\S \to E$ is being treated like a cover. If you have two covers, you can take their joint cover $\S \to E \vee F$, whose $1$--simplices pick up a mixed term: \[(E \vee F) \sm (E \vee F) \simeq E^{\sm 2} \vee F^{\sm 2} \vee (E \sm F)^{\vee 2}.\]  This mixed term prevents double-counting, and it makes it sort of reasonable that it should involve isomorphisms between mixed formal group types.  (This mixed cooperations perspective might have to wait until the chapter on unstable contexts.)

I'm fairly certain that the monad associated to the unstable composite adjunction is monoidal.  It show immediately follow that the unstable $E$--homology descent object gives a quasicoherent sheaf over the unstable $E$--homology context formed by taking the unstable $E$--homologies of all of the spheres\ldots

Does the adjective ``Cartesian'' make sense here?  Is it still the case that the topological object is always ``Cartesian'', and $\pi_*$ preserves Cartesianness in the presence of loads of flatness hypotheses on $E_* \OS{E}{*}$?


I think the relevant base-change diagram to consider is something like
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}[column sep=2.2cm,row sep=2cm]
\CatOf{Algebras}_E \arrow{r}{\eta_F} \arrow[leftarrow, shift left=0.20cm]{d}{\eta_E} & \text{$F \circ E$ algebras} \arrow{d} \\
\CatOf{Spaces} \arrow[leftarrow,shift left=0.20cm]{u} \arrow[shift left=0.20cm]{r}{\eta_F} \arrow[leftarrow, shift right=0.20cm]{r} & \CatOf{Algebras}_F.
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
A space $X$ gets pushed around this diagram like: up to $E \circ X$, over to $F \circ E \circ X$, down to $F \circ E \circ X$, where it receives a natural map \[F \circ X \to F \circ E \circ X.\]  In the case $E = F$, this is the interesting unit map, i.e., the coaction map.  Probably $\pi_* F \circ E \circ X$ is also the recipient of some map connected to the unstable version of \FH.

--------

I think that the unstable descent object along $E \vee F$ receives a map from a ``split descent object'', along the following lines.  Consider the $1$--simplices in $\sheaf{UD}_{E \vee F}(X)$:
\begin{align*}
(F \vee E) \circ (F \vee E) \circ X & \simeq F \circ (F \vee E) \circ X \times E \circ (F \vee E) \circ X \\
& \simeq F \circ (F \circ X \times E \circ X) \times E \circ (F \circ X \times E \circ X) \\
& \from (F \circ F \circ X \times F \circ E \circ X) \times (E \circ F \circ X \times E \circ E \circ X),
\end{align*}
where the last map is a K\"unneth-type map...?  (Actually, I'm not so sure about this now. I thought that having K\"unneth isomorphisms would mean that there would be an equivalence $E \circ (X \times Y) \simeq E \circ X \times E \circ Y$, but now I'm skeptical.  I think there's a map leftward of sets, but this isn't big enough: the Cartesian product of groups is (often) much smaller than the tensor product.)

Anyway, if there were some splitting like this, the next step would be to check if setting $E = F$ has mechanisms in it to prevent double-counting.  (As a side question: is it clear that the unstable $E$--completion is equivalent to the unstable $E \vee E$--completion?)

Probably a lot of my questions would be cleared up by actually trying to write down where the unstable coaction map comes from.  Good grief.





\section{Unstable cooperations in additive homology}\label{UnstableSteenrodCoops}

The bar spectral sequence: connectivity assumption, it's a spectral sequence of Hopf algebras, interaction with the $\circ$--product structure

Restricting to additive cooperations: the indecomposable quotient

The homology suspension element, the relation $e \circ e = b_{(0)}$, and passing to the stabilization.  I think that the relation above is analogous to $S^1 \sm S^1 \simeq \CP^1$?

\todo{Neil's MO answer about $H_* K(\Z, 3)$: http://mathoverflow.net/a/216041/1094}


-----

\begin{example}
Because $H\Z/2$ has field coefficients, it always has K\"unneth isomorphisms, and in particular we can study the Hopf ring \[A_{s, t} = (H\Z/2)_s \OS{H\Z/2}{t} = H_s(K(\Z/2, t); \F_2)\] for $E = H\Z/2$ and $F = H\Z/2$.  We compute this object in three steps.

First, recall that there is a canonical isomorphism $H^*(\RP^\infty; \F_2) \cong \F_2[x]$ for $|x| = 1$.  In turn, the homology groups $H_*(\RP^\infty; \F_2)$ can be written as \[H_*(\RP^\infty; \F_2) \cong \F_2\{a_0, a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n, \ldots\}\] for generators $a_n$ of degree $n$ with Kronecker pairing $\<x^m, a_n\> = \delta{}^m{}_n$.  For degree reasons, the diagonal on cohomology takes the form $\Delta x = x \otimes 1 + 1 \otimes x$ (cf.\ \Cref{HF2StackExample}), from which it follows that the $\ast$--algebra structure on homology takes the form of a divided power algebra on a single class: \[H_*(\RP^\infty; \F_2) \cong \Gamma[a_\emptyset] \cong \bigotimes_{j=0}^\infty \F_2[a_{(j)}] / (a_{(j)})^2.\]  Mysteriously, we have labeled the generating class ``$a_\emptyset$'' and defined $a_\emptyset^{[2^j]} =: a_{(j)}$. This notation will align with complications later in the example.

Second, using the fact that $\RP^\infty \simeq K(\Z/2, 1) \simeq B\Z/2$ has a bar filtration, we study the associated bar spectral sequence, which has the signature \[E^2_{*, *} = \Tor^{H_*(\Z/2; \F_2)}_{*, *}(\F_2, \F_2) \Rightarrow H_*(K(\Z/2, 1); \F_2).\]  The homology of the discrete group $\Z/2$ can be expressed as an algebra as
\[
H_*(\Z/2; \F_2) \cong \left. \F_2[\underline 0, \underline 1] \middle/ \left(\begin{array}{c} \underline 0 = 1 \\ \underline 1^{\ast 2} = \underline 0\end{array}\right) \right. \cong \F_2[\underline 1 - 1] / (\underline 1 - 1)^{\ast 2} =: \F_2[a_\emptyset] / a_\emptyset^{\ast 2},
\]
where $\underline n$ denotes the degree--zero class representing the point $n$ in $\Z/2$ and we have additionally defined $a_\emptyset := \underline 1 - 1$.  The $\Tor$ groups of this truncated polynomial algebra form a divided power algebra~\cite{TateResolutions}: \[\Tor^{H_*(\Z/2; \F_2)}_{*, *} \cong \Gamma[a_\emptyset].\]  It follows that the bar spectral sequence collapses at $E^2 = E^\infty$, and there are no differentials.

Third, we use the second step as the base of an inductive argument, powered by Ravenel and Wilson's key lemma~\cite[Theorem 2.2]{RavenelWilson}, to analyze the other bar spectral sequences: \[\Tor^{H_*(K(\Z/2, t); \F_2)}_{*, *}(\F_2; \F_2) \Rightarrow H_*(K(\Z/2, t+1); \F_2).\]  Inductively assume that the $t$\th level $A_{*, t}$ of the Hopf ring is an exterior $\ast$--algebra on classes which are $t$--fold $\circ$--products of the classes $a_{(j)}$.  It follows that the $\Tor$ groups of the bar spectral sequence computing $A_{t+1, *}$ form a divided power algebra generated by the same $t$--fold $\circ$--products.  An analogue of another Ravenel--Wilson lemma~\cite[Lemma 9.5]{RavenelWilson} gives a congruence\footnote{It's conceivable that this congruence can be repaired to an equality, since the $2$--series for $\G_a$ is so abbreviated.  I have not worked this out.} \[(a_{(j_1)} \circ \cdots \circ a_{(j_t)})^{[2^{j_{t+1}}]} \equiv a_{(j_1)} \circ \cdots \circ a_{(j_t)} \circ a_{(j_{t+1})} \pmod{\text{decomposables}}.\]  It follows from the key lemma~\cite[Theorem 2.2]{RavenelWilson}, which lets us transport differentials from earlier bar spectral sequences to the current one by applying the $\circ$--product, that the differentials vanish:
\begin{align*}
d((a_{(j_1)} \circ \cdots \circ a_{(j_t)})^{[2^{j_{t+1}}]}) & \equiv d(a_{(j_1)} \circ \cdots \circ a_{(j_t)} \circ a_{(j_{t+1})}) \pmod{\text{decomposables}} \\
& = a_{(j_1)} \circ d(a_{(j_2)} \circ \cdots \circ a_{(j_{t+1})}) = 0.
\end{align*}
Hence, the spectral sequence collapses and the induction holds.  It follows that \[A_{*, *} \stackrel\cong\leftarrow \bigoplus_{t=0}^\infty (H_*(\RP^\infty; \F_2))^{\wedge t},\] where $(-)^{\wedge t}$ denotes the $t$\textsuperscript{th} exterior power in the category of Hopf algebras.  The leftward direction of this isomorphism is realized by the $\circ$--product.
\end{example}

\begin{definition}
We spell out some of the Hopf algebra constructions named above.  For a cocommutative $R$--coalgebra $C$, we define its free commutative and cocommutative Hopf $R$--algebra~\cite{Takeuchi} to have underlying algebra \[\frac{\operatorname{SymmetricAlgebra} \left(C \otimes_R (\chi C)\right)}{\left( \begin{array}{c} c \otimes \chi c = 1 \end{array} \right)}\] with diagonal \[\Delta(c_1 \otimes \cdots \otimes c_k \otimes \chi c'_1 \otimes \cdots \otimes \chi c'_{k'}) = \Delta c_1 \otimes \cdots \otimes \Delta c_k \otimes \chi (\Delta c'_1) \otimes \cdots \otimes \chi(\Delta c'_{k'})\] and antipode \[\chi(c_1 \otimes \cdots \otimes c_k \otimes \chi c'_1 \otimes \cdots \otimes \chi c'_{k'}) = \chi c_1 \otimes \cdots \otimes \chi c_k \otimes c'_1 \otimes \cdots \otimes c'_{k'}.\]  Then, given a Hopf $R$--algebra $A$, we define the free Hopf ring~\cite[Definition 4.2, Proposition 2.16]{HuntonTurner} to be \[\left. \bigoplus_{k=0}^\infty A^{\wedge_R k} \middle/ \left(x \wedge y = \sum_i (x'_i \ast y') \wedge (x''_i \ast y'') \middle| \begin{array}{c} y = y' \ast y'', \\ \Delta x = \sum_i x'_i \otimes x''_i \end{array} \right) \right.\] with $\circ$--product given by the natural maps $A^{\wedge_R n} \otimes_R A^{\wedge_R m} \to A^{\wedge_R (n+m)}$.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
The odd--primary analogue of this result appears in Wilson's book~\cite[Theorem 8.5]{Wilson}.  In that situation, the bar spectral sequences do not degenerate but rather have a single family of differentials, and the result imposes a single relation on the free Hopf ring.
\end{remark}

\todo[inline]{Pass to the additive unstable cooperations and note that you recover the \emph{monoid of endomorphisms} of $\G_a$.  In algebraic terms, this looks like the dual Steenrod algebra where $\xi_0$ has not been inverted.}











\section{Complex-orientable cooperations}

Our goal for today is to study the mixed unstable cooperations $E_* \OS{MU}{2*}$ for a complex-orientable cohomology theory $E$.

----

\needproof{Coalgebraic formal schemes}

Let $R$ and $S$ be graded rings.  We can form a Hopf ring over $R$ by forming the ``ring--ring'' $R[S]$: as an $R$--module, this is free and generated by symbols $[s]$ for $s \in S$.  The two Hopf ring products $\ast$ and $\circ$ are determined by the formulas
\begin{align*}
[s] \ast [s'] & = [s + s'], &
[s] \circ [s'] & = [s \cdot s'],
\end{align*}
and distributivity over $\circ$ over $\ast$ is enforced by an $R$--module quotient.

Given an $R$--coalgebra $C$, we can form the free commutative Hopf algebra on $C$ by taking its associated symmetric algebra.  This is a degenerate case of a free Hopf ring construction: taking $S$ to be an auxiliary ring, we can form a free Hopf ring under $R[S]$ spanned by $R[S]$ and free $\ast$-- and $\circ$--products of elements of $C$.

\begin{definition}\todo{I don't like the upper-$R$ notation.  Having a scheme theoretic description of this object should let us pick a better name.}
Let $E_*^R \OS{G}{*}$ be the quotient of the free Hopf ring under $E_*[G^*]$ generated by $C = E_* \CP^\infty$ by the relation \[b(s) +_{[G]} b(t) = b(s +_E t),\] where $b(s) = \sum_i b_i x^i$ and hence
\begin{align*}
b(s +_E t) & = \sum_n b_n \left(\sum_{i, j} a_{ij}^E s^i t^j \right)^n, \\
b(s) +_{[G]} b(t) & = \bigast_{i, j} [a_{ij}^G] \circ \left( \sum_k b_k s^k \right)^{\circ i} \circ \left( \sum_\ell b_\ell t^\ell \right)^{\circ j}.
\end{align*}
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
There is a natural map $E_*^R \OS{G}{*} \to E_* \OS{G}{*}$ for complex-orientable ring spectra $E$ and $G$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
\citeme{Theorem 3.8 of RW, an easy pullback argument}
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
The coalgebraic formal scheme $\Sch Q^* E_*^R \OS{G}{*}$ gives a model \[\Sch Q^* E_*^R \OS{G}{*} \cong \InternalHom{FormalGroups}(\CP^\infty_E, \CP^\infty_G).\]
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
\todo{I don't know how to prove this. I assume it's true, though.}
\end{proof}

----
\citeme{Pages 266--270 of Ravenel--Wilson, especially the bottom of 268.}

We begin by calculating $H\F_{p*} \OS{BP}{2*}$.  One might think that this is a first guess at an accomplishable task, but we will quickly show that it is, in a certain sense, the universal example of this calculation.  We will show the following theorem:
\begin{theorem}\label{HFpBPCooperationsTheorem}
The natural homomorphism \[H\F_{p*}^R \OS{BP}{2*} \to H\F_{p*} \OS{BP}{2*}\] is an isomorphism.  In particular, $H\F_{p*} \OS{BP}{2*}$ is even--concentrated.
\end{theorem}
\noindent We will prove this by a fairly elaborate counting argument, and as such our first move will be to produce an upper bound for the size of the source Hopf ring.  To abbreviate notation, we will write $H$ for $H\F_p$ for the remainder of the lecture.

\begin{lemma}
As a $\circ$--algebra, \[Q^* H_0^R \OS{BP}{2*} \cong \F_p[[v_n] - [0_{-|v_n|}] \mid n \ge 1],\] where $0_{-|v_n|}$ denotes the null element of $BP^{|v_n|}(*)$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
By construction, $H_0^R \OS{BP}{2*}$ is the Hopf ring-ring $\F_p[BP^*]$.  Calculating modulo $\ast$--decomposables,
\begin{align*}
0 & = ([x] - [0]) \ast ([y] - [0]) \\
& = [x + y] - [x] - [y] + [0] \\
& = ([x + y] - [0]) - ([x] - [0]) - ([y] - [0]).
\end{align*}
It follows that a $\Z_{(p)}$--basis of $BP^*$ gives an $\F_p$--basis of $Q^* \F_p[BP^*]$ under the map $x \mapsto [x] - [0]$.  Finally, since \[([x] - [0]) \circ ([y] - [0]) = ([xy] - [0]),\] we see that the image of the polynomial generators $v_n$ freely generate the $\circ$--product structure, proving the lemma.
\end{proof}

Directly from the definition of $H_*^R \OS{MU}{2*}$, we now know that $Q^* H_*^R \OS{MU}{2*}$ is generated by $[v_n] - [0_{-|v_n|}]$ for $n \ge 1$ and $b_j$, $j \ge 0$.  In fact, it suffices to consider $b_{p^i} = b_{(i)}$, $i \ge 0$.\citeme{Lemma 4.14 of Ravenel Wilson}

\textbf{Insert this somehow. Probably it belongs back in an earlier discussion:}
\begin{lemma}
In $Q^* H_* \OS{BP}{2} / I^{\circ 2} \circ Q^* H_* \OS{BP}{2}$, for any $n$ we have \[\sum_{i=1}^n [v_i] \circ b_{(n-i)}^{\circ p^i} = 0.\]
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
\citeme{Lemma 3.14 of Ravenel Wilson}
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
Let $r_n$, the $n${\th} relation, denote the same sum taken in $Q^* H_*^R \OS{BP}{2*}$ instead.  Then $r_n$ is in the ideal generated by $I^{\circ 2}$. \qed \todo{Ravenel and Wilson are working with $\OS{MU}{2*}$ here, so they also include $[x_{2i}]$ for $i \ne p^j - 1$.  I don't think we need to.}
\end{corollary}

\begin{lemma}\citeme{Lemma 4.15.b of Ravenel Wilson. Very tedious.}
The sequence $(r_1, r_2, \ldots)$ is regular in the polynomial algebra \[A = \F_p[[x_{2i}], b_{(j)} \mid i > 0, j \ge 0]. \qed\] 
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}
Set
\begin{align*}
c_{i,j} & = \dim_{\F_p} Q^* H_i^R \OS{BP}{2j}, &
d_{i,j} & = \dim_{\F_p} \F_p[[v_n], b_{(0)}]_{i,j}.
\end{align*}
Then $c_{i,j} \le d_{i,j}$ and $d_{i,j} = d_{i+2,j+1}$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
We have seen that $c_{i,j}$ is bounded by the $\F_p$--dimension of $\F_p[[v_n], b_{(j)}]_{i,j}$ modulo the ideal $(r_1, r_2, \ldots)$.  But, since this ideal is regular and $|r_j| = |b_{(j)}|$, this is the same count as $d_{i,j}$.  The other relation among the $d_{i,j}$ follows from multiplication by $b_{(0)}$, with $|b_{(0)}| = (2, 1)$.\todo{We also need that one of the bidegrees of $[v_n]$ is zero, right?}
\end{proof}

This completes the estimation portion of the argument.  We now turn to showing that this estimation is \emph{sharp} and that the natural map is \emph{onto}, and hence an isomorphism, using the bar spectral sequence.  Recalling that the bar spectral sequence converges to a the homology of the \emph{connective} delooping, let $\OS{BP}{2*}'$ denote the connected component of $\OS{BP}{2*}$ containing $[0_{2*}]$.  We will then demonstrate the following theorem inductively:
\begin{theorem}\label{HFpBPCooperationsInduction}
Take $k$ to be the induction index.
\begin{enumerate}
\item $Q^* H_{\le 2(k-1)} \OS{BP}{2j}'$ is generated by $\circ$--products of the $[v_n]$ and $b_{(j)}$.
\item $H_{\le 2(k-1)} \OS{BP}{2*}'$ is isomorphic to a polynomial algebra in this range.
\item For $0 < i \le 2(k-1)$, we have $d_{i,j} = \dim_{\F_p} Q^* H_i \OS{BP}{2j}$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

Before addressing the theorem, we show that this finishes our calculation:
\begin{proof}[{Proof of \Cref{HFpBPCooperationsTheorem}, assuming \Cref{HFpBPCooperationsInduction} for all $k$}]
Recall that we are considering the natural map \[H_*^R \OS{BP}{2*} \to H_* \OS{BP}{2*}.\]  The first part of \Cref{HFpBPCooperationsInduction} shows that this map is a surjection.  The third part of \Cref{HFpBPCooperationsInduction} together with our counting estimate shows that the induced map \[Q^* H_*^R \OS{BP}{2*} \to Q^* H_* \OS{BP}{2*}\] is an isomorphism.  Finally, the second part of \Cref{HFpBPCooperationsInduction} says that the original map, before passing to $\ast$--indecomposables, must be an isomorphism as well.
\end{proof}

\begin{proof}[{Proof of \Cref{HFpBPCooperationsInduction}}]
The infinite loopspaces in $\OS{BP}{2*}$ are related by $\Loops^2 \OS{BP}{2(*+1)}' = \OS{BP}{2*}$, so we will use two bar spectral sequences to extract information about $\OS{BP}{2(*+1)}'$ from $\OS{BP}{2*}$.  Since we have assumed that $H_{\le 2(k-1)} \OS{BP}{2*}$ is polynomial in the indicated range, we know that in the first spectral sequence \[E^2_{*, *} = \Tor^{H_* \OS{BP}{2*}}_{*, *}(\F_p, \F_p) \Rightarrow H_* \OS{BP}{2*+1}\] the $E^2$--page is, in the same range, exterior on generators in $\Tor$--degree $1$ and topological degree one higher than the generators in the polynomial algebra.  Since differentials lower $\Tor$--degree, the spectral sequence is multiplicative, and there are no classes on the $0$--line, it collapses in the range $[0, 2k-1]$.  Additionally, since all the classes are in odd topological degree, there are no algebra extension problems, and we conclude that $H_* \OS{BP}{2(k-1)+1}$ is indeed exterior up through degree $(2k-1)$.

We now consider the second bar spectral sequence \[E^2_{*, *} = \Tor^{H_* \OS{BP}{2*+1}}_{*, *}(\F_p, \F_p) \Rightarrow H_* \OS{BP}{2(*+1)}.\]  The $\Tor$ algebra of an exterior algebra is divided power on a class of topological dimension one higher.  Since these classes are now all in even degrees, the spectral sequence collapses in the range $[0, 2k]$.  Additionally, these primitive classes are related to the original generating classes by double suspension, i.e., by circling with $b_{(0)}$.  This shows the first inductive claim on the primitive classes through degree $2k$, and we must work to show that this is enough.\todo{This isn't done: see the bottom of page 269 in Ravenel--Wilson.  It's an easy argument: the differences between $\gamma_{p^i}(x)$ and the classes captured thus far all lie in lower filtration.}

\todo{Then, the top of page 270 shows claims 2 and 3.  The point is that we have already established surjectivity, so we can now use our size bounds.  The algebra is too big if there are any leftover indecomposables, so everything is decomposable in terms of the generators we've found, and we're furthermore exactly of the right size to be polynomial.}
\end{proof}

\todo{This argument is distinct from the argument on the next day, which induces on $j$ rather than on $i$.  That's worth making a point of.}

\subsection*{Now walk down to any complex-orientable $E$}

The main theorem: The Ravenel--Wilson calculation of $E_* \OS{MU}{*}$ for complex orientable $E$

This follows from: Since $H\Z_* \OS{MU}{2*}$ is $\Z$--free and even, $MU_* \OS{MU}{2*}$ is $MU_*$--free and even.  It follows that since the free Hopf ring map to $H\Z_* \OS{MU}{2*}$ is an isomorphism, so is the one tensored up to $MU_*$.

This follows from: Calculation of $H\Z_* \OS{MU}{2*}$: no torsion, since $H\F_{p*} \OS{MU}{2*}$ is even, and since the free map is an isomorphism for all primes it's an isomorphism integrally

This follows from: Since $MU_{(p)}$ splits multiplicatively as a wedge of $BP$s, it suffices to show the freeness and evenness of $H\F_{p*} \OS{BP}{2*}$.














\section{Cooperations between theories at geometric points}

\todo{This isn't a good title. You specifically mean from the additive point to a finite height point.}

Throughout today, we will write $K$ for a Morava $K$--theory $K_\Gamma$ (which, if you like, you can take to be $K(d)$) and $A$ for a finitely generated abelian group, and $H$ for the associated Eilenberg--Mac Lane spectrum.  Our goal is to study the unstable mixed cooperations $K_* \OS{H}{*}$.  Of course, this fits into our broader program of understanding various forms of unstable cooperations, especially if we were to pursue a ``stalkwise analysis'' of the sort in \Cref{ChapterFiniteSpectra}.  However, this calculation is especially interesting because of the appearance of the Eilenberg--Mac Lane spaces $\OS{H}{*}$ in other settings.  For instance, if we want to analyze the $K$--homology of a Postnikov tower (as we will in \Cref{ChapterSigmaOrientation}), we will naturally encounter pieces of $K_* \OS{H}{*}$, and we would be wise to have a firm handle on these objects.  It is another tribute to the power of structure that the successful way to approach this computation is not one-at-a-time, as one coming from the Postnikov perspective might attempt, but all-at-once, as suggested by the unstable cooperations picture.

Our calculation will eventually turn into an induction, so we will pursue a simple example first: the $K$--theory of just the classifying space $BA$, rather than a general Eilenberg--Mac Lane space.  Since $K$--theory has K\"unneth isomorphisms and $B(A_1 \times A_2) \simeq BA_1 \times BA_2$, it suffices to do the computation just for $A = C_{p^j}$.

\begin{theorem}\citeme{Theorem 5.7 of RW, or Prop 2.4.4 of HL}
There is an isomorphism \[BS^1[p^j]_K \cong BS^1_K[p^j].\]
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Consider the diagram of spherical fibrations:\todo{Put in a pullback corner here.}
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
S^1 \arrow{r} \arrow[-,double]{d} & B(S^1[p^j]) \arrow{r} \arrow{d} & BS^1 \arrow{d}{p^j} \\
S^1 \arrow{r} & ES^1 \arrow{r} & BS^1.
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
The induced long exact sequence (known as the Gysin sequence, or as the couple in the Serre spectral sequence for the first fibration) takes the form
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
& K_* BS^1 \arrow{rd}{- \frown [p^j](x)} \\
K_*(BS^1[p^j]) \arrow{ru} & & K_* BS^1 \arrow{ll}{\partial}
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
where $x$ is a coordinate on $BS^1_K$.  Because $BS^1_K$ is of finite height, the right diagonal map is surjective.  It follows that $\partial = 0$, and so this gives a short exact sequence of Hopf algebras, which we can reinterpret as a short exact sequence of group schemes \[B(S^1[p^j])_K \to BS^1_K \xrightarrow{p^j} BS^1_K. \qedhere\]
\end{proof}

There are a couple of approaches to the rest of this calculation, i.e., $K_* \OS{H}{q}$ for $q > 1$.  The original, due to Ravenel and Wilson, is to complete the calculation for the smallest abelian group $C_p$ and then induct upward toward more complicated groups like $C_{p^j}$ and $C_{p^\infty}$.  More recently, there is also a preprint of Hopkins and Lurie that begins with $A = C_{p^\infty}$ and then works downward.  We will do the \emph{easy} parts of both calculations, to give a feel for their relative strengths and deficiencies.

The Ravenel--Wilson version of the calculation proceeds much along the same lines as \Cref{UnstableSteenrodCoops}.  We will study the bar spectral sequences \[\Tor^{K_* \OS{H}{q}}_{*, *}(K_*, K_*) \Rightarrow K_* \OS{H}{q+1}\] for different indices $q$ and use the $\circ$--product to push differentials around among them.  We begin by rephrasing the calculation above in terms of the case $q = 0$.\citeme{Theorem 8.1 of RW}  In that setting, the ground algebra is given by \[K_* \OS{H\Z/p^j}{0} = K_*[[1]] / \<[1]^{p^j} - 1\> = K_*[[1] - [0]] / \<[1] - [0]\>^{p^j}.\]  Then, the $\Tor$--algebra for the truncated polynomial algebra $K_*[a_\emptyset] / a_\emptyset^{p^j}$ is given by the formula \[\Tor^{K_*[a_\emptyset] / a_\emptyset^{p^j}}_{*, *}(K_*, K_*) = \Lambda[\sigma a_\emptyset] \otimes \Gamma[\phi a_\emptyset],\] the combination of an exterior algebra and a divided power algebra.  We know which classes are supposed to survive this spectral sequence, and hence we know where the differentials must be:
\begin{align*}
d(\phi a_\emptyset)^{[p^{dj}]} & = \sigma a_\emptyset, \\
\Rightarrow d(\phi a_\emptyset)^{[i + p^{dj}]} & = \sigma a_\emptyset \cdot (\phi a_\emptyset)^{[i]}.
\end{align*}
After this differential the spectral sequence collapses, but there are some multiplicative extensions to sort out when $j > 1$.  Of course, these are all determined by already knowing the multiplicative structure on $K_* \OS{H\Z/p^j}{1}$.

We now turn to the general finite case:
\begin{theorem}\citeme{Theorems 9.2 and 11.1 of RW}
Using the $\circ$--product, \[K_* \OS{H\Z/p^j}{q} = \Alt^q \OS{H\Z/p^j}{1}.\]
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}[Proof sketch]
The inductive step turns out to be extremely index-rich, so I won't be so explicit or complete, but I'll point out the major landmarks.  It will be useful to use the shorthand $a_{(i)} = a_\emptyset^{[p^i]}$, where $(i)$ is thought of as a multi-index with one entry.

We proceed by induction, assuming that $K_* \OS{H\Z/p^j}{q} = \Alt^q \OS{H\Z/p^j}{1}$ for a fixed $q$.  Computing the algebraic homology of $K_* \OS{H\Z/p^j}{q}$ yields a tensor of divided power and exterior classes, a pair for each algebra generator of $K_* \OS{H\Z/p^j}{q}$.  There is then a wonderful rewriting formula:\citeme{Ravenel Wilson, somewhere} \[(\phi a_{(i_1, \ldots, i_q)})^{[p^j]} \equiv  (\phi a_{(i_1, \ldots, i_{q-1})})^{[p^j]} \circ a_{(i_q + j)} \mod *\text{--decomposables}.\]  Since every class can be so decomposed, all the differentials and extensions are determined by the previous spectral sequence.  In particular, classes are hit by differentials exactly when $i_q + j$ is large enough.  It follows that the inductive assumption that $K_* \OS{H\Z/p^j}{q+1}$ is an exterior power holds, and the class $(\phi a_{(i_1, \ldots, i_q)})^{[p^j]}$ represents $a_{(j, i_1 + j, \ldots, i_q + j)}$.\todo{Indicate exactly where the intertwining between different values of $j$ happens.}
\end{proof}

\todo{Mike has said something about the pairing $C_{p^j} \times C_{p^j}^* \to \Q/\Z$ not being functorial in $j$ (so as to pass to the direct limit) which gave me pause.  I should make sure I'm not messing something up here.}

The case $j = 1$ of this proof is messy enough, and the case of a general $j$ requires interrelating the cases using the restriction map $C_{p^j} \to C_{p^{j+1}}$ and the projection map $C_{p^{j+1}} \to C_{p^j}$.  Then, these tools are revisited to give a computation in the limiting case $A = C_{p^\infty}$, where there's a $p$--adic equivalence $HC_{p^\infty} \simeq\widehat{{}_p} \Susp H\Z$.\citeme{Theorem 12.4 of RW}  The calculation in this setting is the most interesting one of all --- after all, it contains the case $BS^1_K$, which is of special interest to us.  Remarkable, it is easier to access directly than passing through all of this intermediate work.  To begin, we need the following algebraic calculation:

\begin{theorem}\citeme{Theorem 2.2.10 of Hopkins--Lurie}\todo{Use the same cohomology notation you have been using for the cohomology of formal groups on previous days.}
Suppose we have an exact sequence of Hopf $k$--algebras \[k \to A' \to A \xrightarrow{u} A'' \to k\] such that $A$ is connected and $F$--divisible, $A'$ is finite--dimensional, and the map $u$ factors through the relative Frobenius ${A''}^{(p)} \to A''$.  Write $\partial: \Ext^1 A' \to \Ext^2 A''$ for the going--around map.  The following are true:
\begin{itemize}
\item The Hopf algebra $A''$ is connected and $F$--divisible.
\item The map $\partial$ induces an isomorphism \[\Sym^* \Ext^1 A' \to \Ext^* A''.\]
\item Let $y_1, \ldots, y_n$ form a basis for $\Ext^1 A'$.  Then $\Ext^* A'$ is freely generated by the elements $y_*$ as a module over $\Ext^* A$. \qed
\end{itemize}
\end{theorem}

\begin{corollary}\citeme{Example 2.2.12 of Hopkins--Lurie}
If $A$ is a connected $p$--divisible Hopf $k$--algebra, then \[k \to A[p^j] \to A \xrightarrow{p^j} A \to k\] is such an exact sequence.  Hence, $\Ext^* A$ is isomorphic to the symmetric algebra on $\Ext^1 A[p^j]$.  \qed
\end{corollary}


\todo[inline]{The point is supposed to be that there are no differentials in the limiting $j \to \infty$ case of the above spectral sequences.  So, all that's left is to check that the pairing gives the right isomorphism, which is an exercise in counting dimensions.  This is Prop 2.4.11 in Hopkins--Lurie.}





\begin{remark}
You'll notice that in $K_* \OS{H}{q+1}$ if we let the $q$--index tend to $\infty$, we get the $K$--homology of a point.  This is another way to see that the stable cooperations $K_* H$ vanish, meaning that the \emph{only} information present comes from unstable cooperations.\todo{We could even provide a quick proof of the stable calculation?  Cf.\ http://mathoverflow.net/questions/220952/localization-at-the-johnson-wilson-spectrum-and-rationalization.}
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
Since everything in sight is even, you also get a calculation of the $E$--theory for free.  In fact, as Hopf algebras, \[E_\Gamma \OS{H(\Q/\Z)}{q} \simeq \Alt^q E_\Gamma \OS{H(\Q/\Z)}{1}.\]
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
Also mention the base--change type formula: as an abelian group, a positive characteristic field $k$ splits as a wedge of $C_p$s, so \[K_* \OS{Hk}{*} = K_* \OS{H\F_p}{*} \otimes_{\F_p} k.\]
\end{remark}





Maybe talk about some consequences: the Hopkins--Ravenel--Wilson results on finite Postnikov towers and so on?








\section{Dieudonn\'e modules}

Our goal today is strictly algebraic: we have seen that the category of finite dimension Hopf algebras over a ground field $k$ is an abelian category.  This means that it admits a presentation as the module category for some (possibly noncommutative) ring.  The description of this ring and of the explicit assignment from a group scheme to linear algebraic data is the subject of \emph{Dieudonn\'e theory}.  We will give a survey of some of the results of Dieudonn\'e theory today, starting with three different presentations of the subject.

---

\citeme{Weinstein's geometry of Lubin--Tate spaces notes}

For a formal variety $V$ over the ground ring $k$, let $\Omega^1_{V/k}$ be its module of K\"ahler differentials and let $\Omega^*_{V/k}$ be the algebraic de Rham complex.  If $k$ is a $\Q$--algebra, then higher cohomology vanishes since exact forms can be integrated, but if $k$ has positive characteristic then there's an obstruction to integrating things with exponents of the form $-1 \pmod p$.  Now put a group structure $\G$ on the formal variety.  The translation invariant differentials studied in the theory of the logarithm are those differentials so that $\mu^* - \pi_1^* - \pi_2^*$ is zero (at the chain level).  If we weaken this to requesting that that difference be \emph{exact}, we arrive at the sub--$A$--module $D(\G/A)$ of $H^1_{dR}(\G/A)$ which are cohomologically translation invariant.

\begin{lemma}
Take $A$ to be $\Z$--flat and set $K = A \otimes \Q$.  Let $x$ be a coordinate on $\G$.  We then have a diagram of exact rows
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
0 \arrow{r} & x A\ps{x} \arrow{r} & \left\{ f \in x K\ps{x} \middle| df \in A\ps{x} \right\} \arrow{r}{d} & H^1_{dR}(\G/A) \arrow{r} & 0 \\
0 \arrow{r} & x A\ps{x} \arrow{r} \arrow[-,double]{u} & \left\{ f \in x K\ps{x} \middle| df \in A\ps{X}, \partial f \in A\ps{x,y} \right\} \arrow{u} \arrow{r}{d} & D(\G/A) \arrow{r} \arrow{u} & 0,
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
where $\partial[\omega] = (\mu^* - \pi_1^* - \pi_2^*)[\omega]$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}
In the case that $\G$ is $p$--divisible, there is an exact sequence \[0 \to \omega_{\G} \to D(\G/A) \to \operatorname{Lie} \G^\vee \to 0.\]
\end{lemma}

\begin{remark}
Let $A$ be a complex abelian variety, in which case there is a classical Hodge decomposition \[0 \to H^0(A; \Omega^1) \to H^1_{dR}(A; \C) \to H^1(A; \sheaf O_A) \to 0.\]  The first term agrees with invariant differentials, and the second term agrees with $\operatorname{Lie} A^\vee$.
\end{remark}

\begin{theorem}
Let $A$ be a $\Z_p$--flat ring, let $f_1(x), f_2(x) \in A\ps{x}$ without constant term, and let $\omega \in A\ps{x} dx$ be a differential.  If $f_1 \equiv f_2 \pmod{pA}$, then $f_1^*(\omega) - f_2^*(\omega)$ is exact. \qed \todo{This is a really easy Poincar\'e Lemma type thing.}\todo{Categorically: if $f_1, f_2: V \to V'$ are maps of pointed formal varieties which agree mod $p$, then they induce the same map on $H^1_{dR}$.}
\end{theorem}

\begin{corollary}
Let $f: \G' \to \G$ be a map of pointed varieties which, mod $p$, is a group homomorphism.  Then $f^*$ maps $D(\G/A)$ into $D(\G'/A)$.  Additionally, if $f_3 = \equiv f_1 + f_2 \pmod{p}$ in $\InternalHom{FormalGroups}(\G'/p, \G/p)$ then $f_3^* = f_1^* + f_2^*$ as maps $D(\G/A) \to D(\G'/A)$.  \qed
\end{corollary}

\begin{definition}
Let $k$ be a perfect field of characteristic $p > 0$, and let $\G_0$ be a $p$--divisible group over $k$ of finite height $d$.  Then, choose a lift $\G$ of $\G_0$ to $W(k)$, and define the \textit{(contravariant) Dieudonn\'e module} of $\G_0$ by $M(\G_0) := D(\G / W(k))$.
\end{definition}

This is independent of choice of lift.  (Pick a map just of formal varieties which restricts to the identity on $\G_0$, then use crystallineness.)  This is another statement of what it means for $M$ (or $H^1_{dR}$) to be \textit{crystalline}.

The Frobenius map $x \mapsto x^p$ is a group homomorphism mod $p$, so induces a $\sigma$--linear map $F\co M(\G_0) \to M(\G_0)$.  This means $F(\alpha v) = \sigma(\alpha) F(v)$.  The Verschiebung map is given by the formula \[\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n x^n \mapsto p \sum_{n=1}^\infty a_{pn}^{\sigma^{-1}} x^n,\] and it satisfies $FV = p$.

\todo{Dieudonn\'e theory is also about taking primitives in some sort of cohomology.  Can this be connected to the additivity condition on unstable operations?}
\todo{Weinstein's Section 1 also ends with a discussion of the Dieudonn\'e functor extended to the crystalline site.  This is necessary to get access to the period map.}

---

Let $\G$ be a formal Lie group and consider Cartier's \textit{functor of curves} $C\G = \InternalHom{FormalSchemes}(\A^1, \G)$.  We can imagine three kinds of operations on a curve $\gamma: \A^1 \to \G$:
\begin{itemize}
\item Homothety: given a scalar $a \in A$, we define $[a] \cdot \gamma(t) = \gamma(at)$.
\item Verschiebung: given an integer $n \ge 1$, we define $V_n \gamma(t) = \gamma(t^n)$.
\item Frobenius: given an integer $n \ge 1$, we define \[F_n \gamma(t) = \sum_{i=1}^n{}_{\G} \gamma(\zeta_n t^{1/n}),\] where $\zeta_{n}$ is an $n${\th} root of unity.  This formula is invariant under permuting the root of unity chosen, so gives a series lying in the original ground ring.
\end{itemize}

Fixing a prime $p$, we can define what it means for a curve to be $p$--typical: $\gamma$ is $p$--typical when $F_n \gamma = 0$ for $n \ne p^j$.  This is an algebraic condition, and so we write $D \subseteq C$ for the functor of $p$--typical curves, a subscheme of all curves.  In the case that the base ring is $p$--local, $C\G$ splits as a sum of copies of $D\G$, and there is a natural section $C\G \to D\G$ called $p$--typification.

\begin{remark}
This actually agrees with $p$--typicality as discussed earlier in the semester: a logarithm $\G \to \G_a$ is said to be $p$--typical when, considered as a curve on $\G_a$, it satisfies the definition of $p$--typicality above.  The $p$--typification construction given there is a specialization of a natural one for all curves on a formal group.
\end{remark}

The (covariant) Dieudonn\'e module associated to a $p$--local formal group $\G$ is $D\G$.  It carries a residual action of the homotheties, $V_p$, and $F_p$.

\todo[inline]{We know of a connection between $H_* BU$ and the Witt scheme.  Is there a connection between $E_* MU$ and curves, or $E_* BP$ and $p$--typical curves, which is visible from this perspectve?  Almost definitely!  Also, a connection between curves and divisors: the zero locus of a given curve...}

---

Cartier duality: There is a duality on commutative and cocommutative finite--dimensional Hopf algebras, given by taking the linear dual.  There is also a duality on Dieudonn\'e modules, also given by taking the linear dual.  These also relate the two kind of Dieudonn\'e functors described above.

---

Define $S(n)$ to be the free Hopf algebra on a single generator in degree $n$, so that at odd primes $S(2n+1) = \Lambda[x]$ and $S(2n) = P[x]$ (and at $p = 2$ all the $S(n)$ are polynomial algebras).  Schoeller proves that there's a projective cover $H(n) \to S(n)$.  Most of the time this map is the identity, except in the two cases: $p = 2$ and $n = 2^m k$ for $k$ odd and $m > 0$, or $p > 2$ and $n = 2p^m k$ for $p \nmid k$ and $m > 0$.  In these exceptional cases, $H(n) = \F_p[x_0, x_1, \ldots, x_k]$ with the ``Witt vector diagonal''.

the projective generators

$\CatOf{HopfAlgebras}^{> 0}_{\F_p/}$

Classification of finite Hopf algebras over $\F_p$ with $\Gm$--action

The $H(n)$ form a series of projective \emph{generators} of the category.  So, we can give a Tannakian description of the category as modules over the ``endomorphism ring'' $\mathsf{Hom}(H(*), H(*))$, which is calculable.  You end up seeing the same data as a covariant Dieudonn\'e module, which is cool, and generally given a Hopf algebra $H$ you can build a graded Dieudonn\'e module functor by \[D_n(H) = \CatOf{HopfAlgebras}_{/\F_p}(H(n), H).\]

---

We have only described a framework for encoding Hopf algebras so far.  We also want to incorporate Hopf rings into our discussion, since we are coming off of the study of unstable cooperations.  Hunton and Turner were among the first to consider ``bilinear'' constructions on Hopf algebras in the abstract, and a similar study of bilinearity on the level of Dieudonn\'e modules is due to Goerss and to Buchstaber--Lazarev.  Our definitions are motivated by the following observation:

\begin{lemma}\citeme{Lemma 7.6 of Goerss's bilinear paper, Lemma 7.1.c of Ravenel--Wilson}
The pairing \[\circ \co D(K_\Gamma \OS{H\Z/p^j}{k_1}) \times D(K_\Gamma \OS{H\Z/p^j}{k_2}) \to D(K_\Gamma \OS{H\Z/p^j}{k_1 + k_2})\] is bilinear in $\W(k)$ and satisfies
\begin{align*}
V(x \circ y) & = Vx \circ Vy, &
Fx \circ y & = F(x \circ Vy), &
x \circ Fy & = F(Vx \circ y). \qed
\end{align*}
\end{lemma}

\begin{definition}
The naive tensor product $M \otimes N$ of Dieudonn\'e modules $M$ and $N$ receives the structure of a $\W(k)[V]$--module.  We define the \textit{tensor product of Dieudonn\'e modules} by \[M \boxtimes N = \left.\W(k)[F, V] \otimes_{\W(k)[V]} (M \otimes N) \middle/ \left( \begin{array}{c} 1 \otimes Fx \otimes y = F \otimes x \otimes Vy, \\ 1 \otimes x \otimes Fy = F \otimes Vx \otimes y \end{array} \right) \right. .\]
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}\citeme{Theorem 7.7 of Goerss's bilinear paper}
The natural map \[D(M) \boxtimes D(N) \to D(M \boxtimes N)\] is an isomorphism. \qed
\end{theorem}

Goerss also talks about ``Hopf ring hom'', and how, since many of the Hopf rings appearing in algebraic topology are ``free'', Hopf ring hom off of them agrees with just Hopf algebra hom (or Dieudonne module hom) off of their generating object.  That's probably worth pointing out, since nonadditive unstable operations seem so unwieldy.\todo{It's weird, though, because restricting to additive unstable operations means passing to $\ast$--indecomposables?  That is, the freeness of the $\circ$--product doesn't really seem to get you out of all that much trouble.  I guess a related question is: what's the relationship between $Q^\ast$ and the free Dieudonn\'e algebra functor?  Do they commute?  Almost certainly not...}


You can write down a tensor product for Hopf algebras.  Equation 7.6 has a description of the box tensor functor for Dieudonn\'e modules.  The Dieudonn\'e module functor is monoidal for these two products.\citeme{Corollary 8.14 of Goerss's bilinear paper}


As a running example, you should rephrase a bunch of the results from the previous lecture (on $K(d)_* \OS{Hk}*$) in terms of Dieudonn\'e modules.

\begin{remark}
\todo[inline]{There's also Chapter 3 of Hopkins--Lurie, which constructs an alternating power group scheme without passing through Dieudonn\'e modules.  It should at least be mentioned.}
\end{remark}


Definition of the inverse functor to the Dieudonn\'e module functor?  I think this appears in the formal groups notes.







\section{Brown--Gitler spectra}

Take $X \to Y \to Z$ to be a cofiber sequence of spectra.  Goerss's main theorem is that for $n \not\equiv \pm 1 \pmod{2p}$, there is a short exact sequence of Hopf algebras \[D_n H_* \Loops^\infty X \to D_n H_* \Loops^\infty Y \to D_n H_* \Loops^\infty Z.\]  (This really requires the congruence condition on $n$ and some series study of fibrations of infinite loopspaces due to Moore and Smith.)  It follows from Brown representability that, subject to this congruence condition, there is a spectrum $B_n$ such that \[B_{n*}(X) = D_n H_* \Loops^\infty X.\]




\citeme{Lemma 2.8}Consider a fiber sequence of spectra \[X \xrightarrow i Y \xrightarrow q Z\] with associated fiber sequence of infinite loopspaces \[\Loops^\infty X \xrightarrow{\Loops^\infty i} \Loops^\infty Y \xrightarrow{\Loops^\infty q} \Loops^\infty Z.\]  We may assume that $Y$ and $Z$ are $0$--connected, as this won't affect the value of $D_n \circ H_*$.  We then consider the Postnikov tower of $Y$ relative to $Z$
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
\cdots \arrow{r} & Y_{s+1} \arrow{r}{q_s} & Y_s \arrow{d}{k_s} \arrow{r} & \cdots \arrow{r} & Y_1 \arrow{d}{k_1} \arrow{r}{q_0} & Z \arrow{d}{k_0} \\
& & \Susp^{s+1} HG_s & & \Susp^2 HG_1 & \Susp HG_0
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
as well as the associated fibrations \[X_s \xrightarrow{i_s} Y_s \to Z\] which assemble into the Postnikov tower for $X$
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
\cdots \arrow{r} & X_{s+1} \arrow{r}{r_s} & X_s \arrow{d}{l_s} \arrow{r} & \cdots \arrow{r} & X_1 \cong HG_0 \arrow{d} \\
& & \Susp^{s+1} HG_s & & \Susp^2 HG_1.
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}

For $f\co A \to B$ a map of spectra, we write $f_\sharp = D_n \Loops^\infty f_*$.  Our goal is to prove exactness, so for $y \in D_n H_* \Loops^\infty Y$ with $q_\sharp(y) = 0$ we must produce $x \in D_n H_* \Loops^\infty X$ with $i_\sharp(x) = y$.  Define $y_s \in D_n H_* \Loops^\infty Y_s$ by projection, and we will produce $x_s \in D_n H_* \Loops^\infty X_s$ with $(i_s)_\sharp(x_s) = y_s$, $(r_s)_\sharp x_{s+1} = x_s$.  Then, since $D_n H_* K(G_s, s) = 0$ for $s \gg 0$, the result will follow from
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
D_n H_* \Loops^\infty X \arrow{r}{i_\sharp} \arrow[-,double]{d} & D_n H_* \Loops^\infty Y \arrow[-,double]{d} \\
\lim_s D_n H_* \Loops^\infty X_s \arrow{r} & \lim_s D_n H_* \Loops^\infty Y_s.
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
We have thus reduced to studying the effect of the sharp construction on a fibration involving an Eilenberg--Mac Lane spectrum.

\todo{These two Lemmas involve a lot of fussing around with the Eilenberg--Moore spectral sequence.}
\begin{lemma}\citeme{Lemma 2.5}
Given a fibration sequence \[\Susp^m HG \xrightarrow i X \xrightarrow q Y \xrightarrow k \Susp^{m+1} HG\] with $m \ge 1$ and $n \ne \pm 1 \pmod{2p}$, then the sequence of abelian groups \[D_n H_* \Loops^\infty \Susp^m HG \xrightarrow{i_\sharp} D_n H_* \Loops^\infty X \xrightarrow{q_\sharp} D_n H_* \Loops^\infty Y \xrightarrow{k_\sharp} D_n H_* \Loops^\infty \Susp^{m+1} HG\] is exact. \qed
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}\citeme{Lemma 2.6, corollary of Lemma 2.7}
Let \[HG \xrightarrow i X \xrightarrow q Y \xrightarrow k \Susp HG\] be a fibration sequence where $k_* \pi_1 Y \to G$ is onto.  If $n \not\equiv \pm 1 \pmod{2p}$, then the sequence of abelian groups \[0 \to D_n H_* \Loops^\infty X \xrightarrow{q_\sharp} D_n H_* \Loops^\infty Y \xrightarrow{k_\sharp} D_n H_* \Loops^\infty \Susp HG\] is exact. \qed
\end{lemma}

Note that this latter Lemma means $y_1 = 0$, since $\pi_0 Y = 0$, so we can set $x_1 = 0$.  Inductively, suppose that $x_s$ has been chosen.  Since \[(l_s)_\sharp x_s = (k_s)_\sharp (i_s)_\sharp x_s = (k_s)_\sharp y_s = 0\] there exists, by the earlier Lemma, a $z \in D_n H_* \Loops^\infty X_{s+1}$ with $(r_s)_\sharp z = x_s$.  Since \[(q_s)_\sharp(y_{s+1} - (i_{s+1})_\sharp z) = y_s - (i_s)_\sharp (r_s)_\sharp z = 0\] the earlier Lemma again shows there exists $w \in D_n H_* \Loops^\infty \Susp^s HG_s$ with \[(f_{s+1})_\sharp w = y_{s+1} - (i_{s+1})_\sharp z.\]  We set $x_{s+1} = z + (g_{s+1})_\sharp w$, and one can check that this works.




Then he shows that these recover Brown--Gitler spectra: $H^* B_n$ looks like a chunk of the mod--$p$ Steenrod algebra, up through degree dependent on $n$, and also the natural map $(B_n)_n Z \to H_n Z$ is surjective for finite CW--complexes $Z$.  The second part doesn't seem to be very hard, cf.\ Lemma 3.3.  The cohomology statement is pretty cool: computing homology instead, you get \[H_k B_n = (B_n)_k H\Z = D_n H_* \Loops^\infty K(\Z, n - k) = [Q H_* \Loops^\infty K(\Z, n-k)]_n,\] where the last equality relies on the congruence condition.



Goerss's result on $H_* \OS{E}{*}$ for Landweber flat $E$.  The main point is that this can be interchanged with $E_* B_*$ for the Brown--Gitler spectra $B$, and then also $B_*$ assemble into the stable homotopy type of $\Loops^2 S^3$.




\todo[inline]{Ask Mike (and Jacob?) if there are analogues of these results for $kO$ which explain Mahowald's generalized $K$--theoretic Brown--Gitler spectra.}







\subsection*{Things that belong in this chapter}

Theorem 6.1 of R--W \textit{The Hopf ring for complex bordism} sounds like something related to Quillen's elementary proof.

Section III.11 of Wilson's \textit{Primer} has a synopsis of how additive unstable operations should be treated.  (In particular, he remarks on pp.\ 62-3 that primitives in unstable operations are the \emph{additive} unstable operations, which seems important.)  Possibly this is enough to understand how additive unstable cooperations should be treated, or maybe unstable cooperations generally.

There's also a document by Boardman, Johnson, and Wilson (Chapter 2 of the \textit{Handbook of Algebraic Topology}) that discusses an equivalence between Steve's approach and ``unstable comodules''.  Please read this.

Snowball a discussion of coalgebraic formal schemes into one of these sections.
