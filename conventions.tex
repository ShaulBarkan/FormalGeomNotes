Throughout this book, we use the following conventions:

\begin{itemize}
\item $\CatOf{C}(X, Y)$ will denote the mapping object of arrows $X \to Y$ in a category $\CatOf{C}$.  If $\CatOf{C}$ is an $\infty$--category, this will often be interpreted as a mapping \emph{space}.  If $\CatOf{C}$ has a self-enrichment, we will often write $\underline{\CatOf{C}}(X, Y)$ (or, e.g., $\InternalAut(X)$) to distinguish the internal mapping object from $\CatOf{C}(X, Y)$ the classical mapping set.
\end{itemize}
