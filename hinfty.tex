\section*{Other stuff that goes in here}

Neil's \textit{Finite Subgroups of Formal Groups} has (in addition to lots of results) a section 14 where he talks about the action of a generalized Hecke algebra on the $E$--theory of a space.

Dyer--Lashof operations, the Steenrod operations, and isogenies of the formal additive group \citeme{See Neil's \textit{Steenrod algebra} note, maybe? Talk to Mike?}
