\subsection*{Other stuff that goes in this chapter}

Neil's \textit{Finite Subgroups of Formal Groups} has (in addition to lots of results) a section 14 where he talks about the action of a generalized Hecke algebra on the $E$--theory of a space.

Dyer--Lashof operations, the Steenrod operations, and isogenies of the formal additive group \citeme{See Neil's \textit{Steenrod algebra} note, maybe? Talk to Mike?}

Another augmentation to the notion of a context: working not just with $E_* X$ but with $E_*(X \times BG)$ for finite $G$.
