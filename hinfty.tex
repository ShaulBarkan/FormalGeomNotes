\chapter{Power operations}

\todo{I wish this had a better title.}

\todo{Write an introduction for me.}


\todo[inline]{There should be a context-based presentation of this chapter's material too.  What do contexts for structured ring spectra look like?  Why would you consider them --- what object are you trying to approximate?  How do you guess that the algebraic model is reasonable until you're aware of something like Strickland's theorem?}



\section{Subgroups and level structures}

\todo[inline]{Something that these notes routinely fail to do is to lead into the algebraic geometry in a believable way.  ``Today we're going to talk about isogenies'' --- and then, lo' and behold, isogenies appear the next day in algebraic topology.  This book would read much better if it showed how these structures were guessed to exist to begin with.}

Here's a definition of an isogeny.  Weierstrass preparation can be phrased as saying that a Weierstrass map is a coordinate change and a standard isogeny.\todo{Where does this come from?  It's Strickland's, I know that.}
\begin{definition}
Take $C$ and $D$ to be formal curves over $X$.  A map $f: C \to D$ is an \textit{isogeny} when the induced map $C \to C \times_X D$ exhibits $C$ as a divisor on $C \times_X D$ as $D$--schemes.
\end{definition}


In fact, every map in positive characteristic can be factored as a coordinate change and an isogeny, which is a weak form of preparation.


Lubin's finite quotients of formal groups. (Interaction with the Lubin--Tate moduli problem?  Or does this belong in the next day?)


Write out isogenies of the additive formal group, note that you just get the unstable Steenrod algebra again.  This is a remarkable accident.


Push and pull maps for divisor schemes


Moduli of subgroup divisors


The Drinfel'd moduli ring, level structures

----

\begin{lemma}\citeme{Prop 6.2 of HKR}
The following conditions on a homomorphism \[\phi: \Lambda_r^* \to F[p^r](R)\] are equivalent:
\begin{enumerate}
\item For all $\alpha \ne 0$ in $\Lambda_r^*$, $\phi(\alpha)$ is a unit (resp., not a zero-divisor).
\item The Hopf algebra homomorphism \[R\ps{x} / [p^r](x) \to R^{\Lambda_r^*}\] is an isomorphism (resp., a monomorphism). \qed
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}\citeme{Shortly after Prop 6.2 of HKR. Section 7?}
Let $\L_r(R)$ be the set of all group homomorphism \[\phi: \Lambda_r^* \to F[p^r](R)\] satisfying either of the conditions 1 or 2 above.  This functor is representable by a ring \[L_r(E^*) := S^{-1} E^*(B\Lambda_r)\] that is finite and faithfully flat over $p^{-1} E^*$.  (Here $S$ is generated by the $\phi(\alpha)$ with $\alpha \ne 0$, $\phi: \Lambda_r^* \to F[p^r](E^* B\Lambda_r)$ the canonical map.)
\end{lemma}

---

Section 2: complete local rings

``Galois'' means $R \to S$ a finite extension of integral domains has $R$ as the fixed subring for $\operatorname{Aut}_R(S)$ and $S$ is free over $R$.  Galois extension of rings implies the extension of fraction fields is Galois.  The converse holds for finite (finitely generated as a module) dominant (kernel of $f$ is nilpotent) maps of smooth (regular local ring) schemes.

Section 3: basic facts about formal groups

definition of height

Section 4: basic facts about divisors

Since $x -_F a \dot= x - a$, you can treat the divisor $[a]$ (defined in a coordinate by the ideal sheaf generated by $x - x(a)$) as generated just by $x - a$.

\begin{lemma}\citeme{Prop 4.6 of Finite Subgroups}
Let $D$ and $D'$ be two divisors on $\G$ over $X$.  There is then a closed subscheme $Y \le X$ such that for any map $a: Z \to X$ we have $a^* D \le a^* D'$ if and only if $a$ factors through $Y$. \qed
\end{lemma}

Section 5: quotient by a finite sbgp is again a fml gp

\begin{definition}
A \textit{finite subgroup} of $\G$ will mean a divisor $K$ on $\G$ which is also a subgroup scheme.  Let $\sheaf{O}_{\G/K}$ be the equalizer
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
\sheaf O_{\G/K} \arrow{r} & \sheaf O_{\G} \arrow[shift left=0.2cm]{r}{\mu^*} \arrow[shift right=0.2cm]{r}{\pi^*} & \sheaf O_K \otimes_{\sheaf O_X} \sheaf O_{\G}.
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}\citeme{Theorem 5.3 of Finite Subgroups}
Write $y = N_\pi \mu^* x \in \sheaf O_{\G}$.\footnote{Remember that if $f: X \to Y$ is a finite flat map, then $N_f: \sheaf O_X \to \sheaf O_Y$ is the nonadditive map sending $u$ to the determinant of multiplication by $u$, considered as an $\sheaf O_Y$--linear endomorphism of $\sheaf O_X$.}  Then $y \equiv x^{p^m} \pmod{\m_X}$ and $\sheaf O_{\G/K} = \sheaf O_X\ps{y}$.  Moreover, the projection $\G \to \G/K$ is the categorical cokernel of $K \to \G$.  This all commutes with base change: given $f: Y \to X$ we have $f^* \G / f^* K = f^*(\G/K)$. \qed \todo{Expand this out in the case of a subgroup scheme given by a sum of point divisors.}
\end{lemma}

Section 6: coordinate-free lubin-tate theory

nothing you haven't already seen. in fact, most of it is done in coordinates, with only passing reference to the decoordinatization.

Section 7: level--$A$ structures: smooth, finite, flat

As discussed long ago, for finite abelian $p$--groups there's a scheme \[\InternalHom{FormalGroups}(A, \G)(Y) = \InternalHom{Groups}(A, \G(Y)).\]  If $\G$ were a discrete group, we could decompose this as \[\text{``$\InternalHom{FormalGroups}(A, \G) = \coprod_{B \le A} \Mono(A/B, \G)$''}\] along the different kernel types of homomorphisms, but $\Mono$ does not exist as a scheme.\todo{Come up with a really compelling example.  You had one when you were talking to Danny and Jeremy.  Probably you got it \emph{from} Jeremy.}  Level structures approximate this as best one can be approximating $\G$ by something essentially discrete: an \'etale group scheme.

For a map $\phi: A \to \G(Y)$, we write $[\phi A] = \sum_{a \in A}[\phi(a)]$.  We also write $\Lambda = (\Q_p / \Z_p)^n$, so that $\Lambda[p^m] = (\Z/p^m)^{\times n}$.  Note \[|\CatOf{AbelianGroups}(A, \Lambda)| = |A|^n = \operatorname{rank} \left( \InternalHom{FormalGroups}(A, \G) \to X \right).\]

\begin{definition}
A \textit{level--$A$ structure} on $\G$ over an $X$--scheme $Y$ is a map $\phi: A \to \G(Y)$ such that $[\phi A[p]] \le G[p]$ as divisors.  A \textit{level--$m$ structure} means a level--$\Lambda[p^m]$ structure.
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}\citeme{Prop 7.2-4 of Finite Subgroups}
The functor from schemes over $X$ to sets given by \[Y \mapsto \{\text{level--$A$ structures on $\G$ over Y}\}\] is represented by a finite flat scheme $\Level(A, \G)$ over $X$.  It is contravariantly functorial for monomorphisms of abelian groups.  Also, if $\phi: A \to \G$ is a level structure then $[\phi A]$ is a subgroup divisor and $[\phi A[p^k]] \le \G[p^k]$ for all $k$.  In fact, if $A = \Lambda[p^m]$ then $[\phi A] = \G[p^m]$.  \qed  \todo{I can't imagine proving this.  It's worth noting that it's proven by considering just the universal case, which we know to be smooth.}
\end{lemma}

In Section 26 of FPFP Neil says there's a decomposition into irreducible components \[\operatorname{Hom}(A, \G) = \operatorname{Hom}(A, \G_{\mathrm{red}}) = \bigcup_B \Level(A/B, \G)\] and this $\bigcup$ turns into a $\coprod$ after inverting $p$.  He also mentions this as motivation in Finite Subgroups, but he doesn't appear to prove it?

Section 8: maps among level--$A$ schemes, their Galois behavior

\begin{theorem}\citeme{Theorem 8.1 of Finite Subgroups}
Let $A$, $B$ be finite abelian $p$--groups of rank at most $n$, and let $u: A \to B$ be a monomorphism. Then:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \[\CatOf{FormalSchemes}_X(\Level(B, \G), \Level(A, \G)) = \operatorname{Mono}(A, B).\]
\item Such homomorphisms are detected by the behavior at the generic point.
\item The map $u^!: \Level(B, \G) \to \Level(A, \G)$ is finite and flat.
\item If $B \simeq \Lambda[p^m]$, then $u^!$ is a Galois covering.
\item The torsion subgroup of $\G(\Level(A, \G))$ is $A$. \qed
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

Section 9: epimorphisms of groups become maps of level schemes, quotients by level structures

Let $\G_0$ be a formal group of height $n$ over $X_0 = \Spec \kappa$.  For every $m$, the divisor $p^m[0]$ is a subgroup of $\G_0$.  We write $\G_0\<p^m\>$ for the quotient group $\G_0 / p^m[0]$ and $\G\<m\> \to X\<m\>$ for the universal deformation of $\G_0\<m\> \to X_0$.  Note that $\G_0[p] = p^n[0]$, which induces isomorphisms $\G_0\<m+n\> \to \G_0\<m\>$, and we use this to make as many identifications as we can.

\begin{lemma}\citeme{9.1 of Finite Subgroups}
Let $u: A \to B$ be an epimorphism of abelian $p$--groups wit kernel $|\ker(u)| = p^\ell$.  Then $u$ induces a map \[u_!: \Level(A, \G\<m\>) \to \Level(B, \G\<m+\ell\>).\]  Also, if $A = \Lambda[p^m]$, then $u_!$ is a Galois covering with Galois group \[\Gamma = \{\alpha \in \operatorname{Aut}(A) \mid u\alpha = u\}. \qed\]
\end{lemma}

\begin{corollary}\citeme{Interstitial text between 9.1 and 9.2 of Finite Subgroups}
In particular, the map $A \to 0$ induces a map \[0_!: \Level(A, \G\<m\>) \to \Level(0, \G\<m+\ell\>) = X\<m+\ell\>\] which extracts quotient formal groups from level structures.  In the case $A = \Lambda[p^\ell]$, $0_!$ is just the projection $0^!$. \qed
\end{corollary}

Section 10: moduli of subgroup schemes

\begin{theorem}\citeme{Theorem 10.1 of Finite Subgroups}
The functor \[Y \mapsto \{\text{subgroups of $\G \times_X Y$ of degree $p^m$}\}\] is represented by a finite flat scheme $\Sub_{p^m}(\G)$ over $X$ of degree $|\Sub_{p^m}(\Lambda)|$.  The formation commutes with base change. \qed
\end{theorem}

We can at least give the construction: let $D$ be the universal divisor defined over $Y = \Div_{p^m}(\G)$ with equation $f_D(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{p^m} c_k x^k$.  There are unique elements $a_{ij} \in \sheaf O_Y$ such that \[f(x +_F y) = \sum_{i,j=0}^{p^m-1} a_{ij} x^i y^j \pmod{f(x), f(y)}.\]  Define \[\Sub_{p^m}(\G) = \Spf \sheaf O_Y / (c_0, a_{ij} \mid 0 \le i, j < p^m).\]  Finiteness, flatness, and rank counting are what take real work, starting with an arithmetic fracture square.

Section 13: deformation theory of isogenies

\begin{definition}
Suppose we have a morphism of formal groups
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
\G_0 \arrow{r}{q_0} \arrow{d} & \G'_0 \arrow{d} \\
X_0 \arrow{r}{f_0} & X'_0
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
such that the induced map $\G_0 \to f_0^* \G'_0$ is an isogeny of degree $p^m$.  By a deformation of $q_0$ we mean a prism
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
\mathbb H \arrow{rd}{q} \arrow{dd} & & \mathbb H_0 \arrow{ll} \arrow{rr} \arrow{rd} \arrow{dd} & & \G_0 \arrow{rd}{q_0} \arrow{dd} \\
& \mathbb H' & & \mathbb H'_0 \arrow[crossing over]{ll} \arrow[crossing over]{rr} & & \G'_0 \arrow{dd} \\
Y \arrow{rd}{1} & & Y_0 \arrow{ll} \arrow{rr} \arrow{rd}{1} & & X_0 \arrow{rd}{f_0} \\
& Y \arrow[crossing over,leftarrow]{uu} & & Y_0 \arrow{ll} \arrow{rr} \arrow[crossing over,leftarrow]{uu} & & X'_0,
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
where the middle face is the pullback of the left face, the back-right and front-right faces are pullbacks, so that $q$ is also an isogeny of degree $p^m$.
\end{definition}

Let $\G/X$ be the universal deformation of $\G_0$, let $a: \Sub_{p^m}(\G) \to X$ be the usual projection, and let $K < a^* \G$ be the universal example of a subgroup of degree $p^m$.  As $\Sub_{p^m}(\G)$ is a closed subscheme of $\Div_{p^m}(\G)$ and $\Div_{p^m}(\G)_0 = X_0$, we see that $\Sub_{p^m}(\G)_0 = X_0$.  There is a unique subgroup of order $p^m$ of $\G_0$ defined over $X_0$, viz.\ the divisor $p^m[0] = \Spf \sheaf O_{\G_0} / x^{p^m}$.  In particular, $K_0 = p^m[0] = \ker(q_0)$.  It follows that there is a pullback diagram as shown below:
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
(a^* \G/K)_0 \arrow{r}{\simeq} \arrow{d} & \G_0 / p^m[0] \arrow{r}{\overline q_0, \simeq} \arrow{d} & \G'_0 \arrow{d} \\
\Sub_{p^m}(\G)_0 \arrow{r}{a_0, \simeq} & X_0 \arrow{r}{f_0, \simeq} & X'_0.
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
We see that $a^* \G \to a^* \G/K$ is a deformation of $q_0$, and it is terminal in the category of such.

Now let $\G' / X'$ be the universal deformation of $\G'_0 / X'_0$.  The above construction also exhibits $a^* \G/K$ as a deformation of $\G'_0$, so it is classified by a map $b: \Sub_{p^m}(\G) \to X'$ extending the map $b_0 = f_0 \circ a_0: \Sub_{p^m}(\G)_0 \to X'_0$.

\begin{theorem}\citeme{Prop 13.1 of Finite Subgroups, \emph{hard}}
$b$ is finite and flat of degree $|\Sub_{p^m}(\Lambda)|$. \qed
\end{theorem}

\todo[inline]{Cf. Matt's thesis's Prop 2.5.1: $\Phi$ is a formal group over $\F_p$, $F$ a lift of $\Phi$ to $E_n$, $H$ a finite subgroup of $F(D_k)$, then $F/H$ is a lift of $\Phi$ to $D_k$.  (This is because the quotient map to $F/H$ reduces to $t \mapsto t^{p^r}$ for some $r$ over $\F_p$, which is an endomorphism of $\Phi$, so the quotient map over the residue field doesn't do anything!)  See also Prop 2.5.4, where he characterizes all isogenies of this sort as arising from this construction.}

Section 14: connections to AT

Neil's \textit{Finite Subgroups of Formal Groups} has (in addition to lots of results) a section 14 where he talks about the action of a generalized Hecke algebra on the $E$--theory of a space.  Let $a$ and $b$ be two points of $X$, with fibers $\G_a$ and $\G_b$, and let $q: \G_a \to \G_b$ be an isogeny.  Then there's an induced map $(Z_E)_a \to (Z_E)_b$, functorial in $q$ and natural in $Z$.  ``Certain $\Ext$ groups over this Hecke algebra form the input to spectral sequences that compute homotopy groups of spaces of maps of strictly commutative ring spectra, for example.''  \textbf{This sounds like the beginning of an answer to my context question.}

\begin{theorem}\citeme{See Theorem 2.4.1 of Ando's thesis, though he just cites other people}
Let $R$ be a complete local domain with positive residue characteristic $p$, and let $F$ be a formal group of finite height $d$ over $R$.  If $\sheaf O$ is the ring of integers in the algebraic closure of the fraction field of $R$, then $F(\sheaf O)[p^k] \cong (\Z/p^k)^d$ and $F(\sheaf O)_{\mathrm{tors}} \cong (\Q_p / \Z_p)^d$. \qed

\section{Character theory for Lubin--Tate spectra}

There's a sufficient amount of reliance on character theory in Matt's thesis that we should talk about it.  You should write that action and then backtrack here to see what you need for it.

See Morava's \textit{Local fields} paper

\begin{remark}
Theorem 2.6 of Greenlees--Strickland for a nice transchromatic perspective.  See also work of Stapleton and Schlank--Stapleton, of course.\todo{Flesh this out.}
\end{remark}


------

\begin{theorem}\citeme{Theorem A}
Let $E$ be any complex-oriented cohomology theory.  Take $G$ to be a finite group and let $\CatOf{Ab}_G$ be the full subcategory of the orbit category of $G$ built out of abelian subgroups of $G$.  Finally, let $X$ be a finite $G$--CW complex.  Then, each of the natural maps \[E^*(EG \times_G X) \to \lim_{A \in \CatOf{Ab}_G} E^*(EG \times_A X) \to \int_{A \in \CatOf{Ab}_G} E^*(BA \times X^A)\] becomes an isomorphism after inverting the order of $G$.  In particular, there is an isomorphism \[\frac{1}{|G|} E^* BG \to \lim_{A \in \CatOf{Ab}_G} \frac{1}{|G|} E^* BA. \qed\]
\end{theorem}

This is an analogue of Artin's theorem:
\begin{theorem}
There is an isomorphism \[\frac{1}{|G|} R(G) \to \lim_{C \in \CatOf{Cyclic}_G} \frac{1}{|G|} R(C). \qed\]
\end{theorem}

HKR intro material connecting Theorem A to character theory:

Recall that classical characters for finite groups are defined in the following situation: take $L = \Q^{\mathrm{ab}}$ to be the smallest characteristic $0$ field containing all roots of unity, and for a finite group $G$ let $Cl(G; L)$ be the ring of class functions on $G$ with values in $L$.  The units in the profinite integers $\widehat{\Z}$ act on $L$ as the Galois group over $\Q$, and since $G = \CatOf{Groups}(\widehat{\Z}, G)$ they also act naturally on $G$.  Together, this gives a conjugation action on $Cl(G; L)$: for $\phi \in \widehat{\Z}$, $g \in G$, and $\chi \in Cl(G; L)$, one sets \[(\phi \cdot \chi)(g) = \phi(\chi(\phi^{-1}(g))).\]  The character map is a ring homomorphism \[\chi: R(G) \to Cl(G; L)^{\widehat{\Z}},\] and this induces isomorphisms \[\chi: L \otimes R(G) \xrightarrow{\simeq} Cl(G; L)\] and even \[\chi: \Q \otimes R(G) \xrightarrow{\simeq} Cl(G; L)^{\widehat{\Z}}.\]

Now take $E = E_\Gamma$ to be a Morava $E$--theory of finite height $d = \height(\Gamma)$.  Take $E^*(B\Z_p^d)$ to be topologized by $B(\Z/p^j)^d$.  A character $\alpha: \Z_p^d \to S^1$ will induce a map $\alpha^*: E^* \CP^\infty \to E^* B\Z_p^d$.  We define $L(E^*) = S^{-1} E^*(B\Z_p^d)$, where $S$ is the set of images of a coordinate on $\CP^\infty_E$ under $\alpha^*$ for nonzero characters $\alpha$.  Note that this ring inherits an $\operatorname{Aut}(\Z_p^d)$ action by $E^*$--algebra maps.

The analogue of $Cl(G; L)$ will be $Cl_{d,p}(G; L(E^*))$, defined to be the ring of functions $\chi: G_{d, p} \to L(E^*)$ stable under $G$--orbits.  Noting that \[G_{d,p} = \operatorname{Hom}(\Z_p^d, G),\] one sees that $\operatorname{Aut}(\Z_p^d)$ acts on $G_{d,p}$ and thus on $Cl_{d,p}(G; L(E^*))$ as a ring of $E^*$--algebra maps: given $\phi \in \operatorname{Aut}(\Z_p^d)$, $\alpha \in G_{d,p}$, and $\chi \in Cl_{d,p}(G; L(E^*))$ one lets \[(\phi \cdot \chi)(\alpha) = \phi(\chi(\phi^{-1}(\alpha))).\]

Now we introduce a finite $G$--CW complex $X$.  Let \[\operatorname{Fix}_{d, p}(G, X) = \coprod_{\alpha \in \operatorname{Hom}(\Z_p^d, G)} X^{\operatorname{im} \alpha}.\]  This space has commuting actions of $G$ and $\operatorname{Aut}(\Z_p^d)$.  We set \[Cl_{d, p}(G, X; L(E^*)) = L(E^*) \otimes_{E^*} E^*(\operatorname{Fix}_{d,p}(G, X))^G,\] which is again an $E^*$--algebra acted on by $\operatorname{Aut}(Z_p^d)$.  We define the character map ``componentwise'': a homomorphism $\alpha \in \operatorname{Hom}(\Z_p^d, G)$ induces \[E^*(EG \times_G X) \to E^*(B\Z_p^d) \otimes_{E^*} E^*(X^{\operatorname{im} \alpha}) \to L(E^*) \otimes_{E^*} E^*(X^{\operatorname{im} \alpha}).\]  Taking the direct sum over $\alpha$, this assembles into a map \[\chi_{d,p}^G: E^*(EG \times_G X) \to Cl_{d,p}(G, X; L(E^*))^{\operatorname{Aut}(Z_p^d)}.\]
\todo{Nat taught you how to say all these things with $p$--adic tori, which was \emph{much} clearer.}
\begin{theorem}\citeme{Theorem C}
The invariant ring is $L(E^*)^{\operatorname{Aut}(\Z_p^d)} = p^{-1} E^*$, and $L(E^*)$ is faithfully flat over $p^{-1} E^*$.\todo{Checking this invariant ring claim is easiest done by comparing the functors the two things corepresent.}  The character map $\chi_{d,p}^G$ induces isomorphisms
\begin{align*}
\chi_{d,p}^G \co L(E^*) \otimes_{E^*} E^*(EG \times_G X) & \xrightarrow{\simeq} Cl_{d,p}(G, X; L(E^*)), \\
\chi_{d,p}^G \co p^{-1} E^*(EG \times_G X) & \xrightarrow{\simeq} Cl_{d,p}(G, X; L(E^*))^{\operatorname{Aut}(\Z_p^d)}.
\end{align*}
In particular, when $X = *$, there are isomorphisms
\begin{align*}
\chi_{d,p}^G \co L(E^*) \otimes_{E^*} E^*(BG) & \xrightarrow{\simeq} Cl_{d,p}(G; L(E^*)), \\
\chi_{d,p}^G \co p^{-1} E^*(BG) & \xrightarrow{\simeq} Cl_{d,p}(G; L(E^*))^{\operatorname{Aut}(\Z_p^d)}. \qed
\end{align*}
\end{theorem}

Jack gives an interpretation of this in terms of formal $\sheaf{O}_L$--modules.

------

I also have this summary of Nat's of the classical case:

It's not easy to decipher if you weren't there for the conversation, but here's my take on it. First, the map we wrote down today was the non-equivariant chern character: it mapped non-equivariant $KU \otimes \Q$ to non-equivariant $H\Q$, periodified. The first line on Nat's board points out that if you use this map on Borel-equivariant cohomology, you get nothing interesting: $K^0(BG)$ is interesting, but $H\Q^*(BG) = H\Q^*(*)$ collapses for finite $G$. So, you have to do something more impressive than just directly marry these two constructions to get something interesting.

That bottom row is Nat's suggestion of what ``more interesting'' could mean. (Not really his, of course, but I don't know who did this first. Chern, I suppose.) For an integer $n$, there's an evaluation map of (forgive me) topological stacks \[* \mmod (\Z/n) \times \operatorname{Hom}(* \mmod (\Z/n), * \mmod G) \xrightarrow{\mathrm{ev}} * \mmod G\] which upon applying a global-equivariant theory like $K_G$ gives \[K_{\Z/n}(*) \otimes K_G(\coprod_{\text{conjugacy classes of $g$ in $G$}} *) \xleftarrow{ev^*} K_G(*).\]

Now, apply the genuine $G$-equivariant Chern character to the $K_G$ factor to get \[K_{\Z/n}(*) \otimes H\Q_G(\coprod *) \from K_{\Z/n}(*) \otimes K_G(\coprod *),\] where the coproduct is again taken over conjugacy classes in G. Now, compute $K_{\Z/n}(*) = R(\Z/n) = \Z[x] / (x^n - 1)$, and insert this calculation to get \[K_{\Z/n}(*) \otimes H\Q_G(\coprod *) = \Q(\zeta_n) \otimes (\bigoplus_{\text{conjugacy classes}} \Q),\] where $\zeta_n$ is an $n${\th} root of unity.  As $n$ grows large, this selects sort of the part of the complex numbers $\C$ that the character theory of finite groups cares about, and so following all the composites we've built a map \[K_G(*) \to \C \otimes (\bigoplus_{\text{conjugacy classes}} \C).\]  The claim, finally, is that this map sends a $G$-representation (thought of as a point in $K_G(*)$) to its class function decomposition.







\section{Descending coordinates along level structures}

\todo[inline]{It's not clear to me what theorems about level structures and so forth are best included on this day and which belong back in the lecture above.  We should be able to split things apart into stuff desired for character theory and stuff desired for descent.}

Ando's Theorem 3.4.4: Let $D_j$ be the ring extension of $E_n$ which trivializes the $p^j$--torsion subgroup of $\G_{E_n}$.  Let $H$ be a finite subgroup of $\G_{E_n}(D_k)$.  There is an unstable transformation of ring-valued functors \[E_n X \xrightarrow{\Psi^H} D_j \otimes E_n X,\] and if $F$ is an Ando coordinate then for any line bundle $\L \to X$ there is a formula \[\psi^H(e\L) = \prod_{h \in H} (h +_F e\L) \in D_j \otimes E_n(X).\]

$D_j$ is Galois over $E_n$ with Galois group $\GL_n(\Z/p^j)$.  If $\rho$ is a collection of finite subgroups weighted by elements of $E_n$ which is stable under the action of the Galois group, then $\Psi^\rho$ descends to take values in just $E_n$.  (For example, the entire subgroup has this property.)

This is built by a character map.  Take $H \subseteq F(D_j)[p^j]$ to be a finite subgroup again; then there is a map \[\chi^H: E_n(D_{H^*} X) \to D_j \otimes E_n(X),\] where $D_{H^*}$ denotes the extended power construction on $X$ using the Pontryagin dual of $H$.  This composes to give an operation \[Q^H: MU^{2*}(X) \xrightarrow{P_{H^*}} MU^{2|H|*}(D_{H^*} X) \to E_n^{2|H|*}(D_{H^*} X) \xrightarrow{\chi^H} D_j \otimes E_n^{2|H|*}(X).\]  Then $Q^H$ is a ring homomorphism with effects
\begin{align*}
Q^H F^{MU} & = F/H, &
Q^H(e_{MU} \L) & = \prod_{h \in H} h +_F e\L.
\end{align*}

Then we need to factor $Q^H: MU(X) \to D_j \otimes E_n(X)$ across the orienting map $MU \to E_n$.  Since $E_n$ is Landweber flat and $Q^H$ is a ring map, it suffices to do this for the one--point space, i.e., to construct a ring homomorphism \[\Psi^H: E_n \to D_j\] so that $\Psi^H = \Psi^H(*) \otimes Q^H$.  The first condition above then translates to $\Psi^H F^{MU} = F/H$.

\begin{theorem}\citeme{Theorem 2.5.7 of Matt's thesis}
For each $\star$--isomorphism class of lift $F$ of $\Phi$ to $E_n$, there is a unique choice of coordinate $x$ on $F$, lifting the preferred coordinate on $\Phi$, such that $\alpha^H_* F_x = F_x/H$, or equivalently that $l_H^x = f_H^x$, for all finite subgroups $H$.  (These morphisms are arranged in the following diagram:)
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
F_x \arrow{r}{f_H^x} \arrow[bend left]{rr}{l_H^x} & F_x / H \arrow{r}{g_H^x} & \alpha^H_* F_x \\
F \arrow{u}{x} \arrow{r} & F/H \arrow{u}{x_H} \arrow{r}{g_H} & \alpha^H_* F \arrow{u}{\alpha_* x} ,
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
where $\alpha_H: E_n \to D_k$ is the unique ring homomorphism such that there is a $\star$--isomorphism $g_H: F/H \to \alpha^H_* F$. \qed \todo{This is some serious work, and I don't think we'll prove it.  The main point is that $\alpha^p_* F_x = F_x / p$ can be reimagined as $f_p^x(t) = [p]_{F_x}(t)$, and this already is enough to determine what $x$ is by descending along the power of the maximal ideal in $E_n$, the length of a full level structure, and pieces of a smaller level structure inside of the full one.  It really is a long argument.}
\end{theorem}

\todo[inline]{Section 2.7 of Matt's thesis works the example of a normalized coordinate for $\G_m$. It's \emph{not} the $p$--typical coordinate. It \emph{is} the standard one! Cool.}

\begin{lemma}\citeme{Lemma 3.2.7 of Matt's thesis, BMMS86 page 25, AHS $H_\infty$ appendix}
$P_r(x + y) = \sum_{j=0}^r \operatorname{Tr}_{j,r}^{MU} d^*(P_j x \times P_{r-j}y)$.

\todo[inline]{This expresses the non-additivity of the power operations on $MU$. It's apparently needed in the proof that $Q^H$ acts as it should on Euler classes. It involves transfer formulas, which may mean we need to work that section of HKR into that day.}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Represent $x$ and $y$ by maps
\begin{align*}
U & \xrightarrow{f} X, &
V & \xrightarrow{g} Y.
\end{align*}
Then $P_r(x+y)$ is represented by \[D_r(U \sqcup V) \xrightarrow{D_r(f \sqcup g)} D_r X.\]  There is a decomposition \[D_r(U \sqcup V) = \coprod_{j=0}^r E\Sigma_r \times_{\Sigma_j \times \Sigma_{r-j}} (U^j \times V^{r-j}),\] and on the $j$ factor the map $D_r(f \sqcup g)$ restricts to
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
E\Sigma_r \times_{\Sigma_j \times \Sigma_{r-j}} (U^j \times V^{r-j}) \arrow{r}{E\Sigma_r \times_{\Sigma_j \times \Sigma_{r-j}} (f^j \times g^{r-j})} \arrow{d} & E\Sigma_r \times_{\Sigma_j \times \Sigma_{r-j}} X^r \arrow{d} \\
D_r(U \sqcup V) \arrow{r}{D_r(f \sqcup g)} & D_r X,
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
where the vertical maps are projections.  The counterclockwise composite represents the $j$ summand of $P_r(x+y)$ coming from the decomposition above; the clockwise composite represents the class $\operatorname{Tr}_{j,r}^{MU} d^*(P_j x \times P_{r-j} y)$. \qedhere
\end{proof}

\todo{There's also this useful naturality Lemma for power operations and Euler classes: $P_\pi(eV) = e(D_\pi V \to D_\pi X)$.  Does that come up in the Quillen chapter?  Maybe it should.}

\begin{lemma}\citeme{Prop 3.2.10 of Matt's thesis, see also p.\ 42 of Quillen}
Write $\Delta: B\pi \times X \to D_\pi X$ and let $\L$ be a complex line bundle on $X$.
\[\Delta^* P_\pi(e\L) = \prod_{u \in \pi^*} \left( e\left(\begin{array}{c} E\pi \times_u \C \\ \downarrow \\ B\pi \end{array} \right) +_{MU} e(\L) \right).\]
\end{lemma}

\needproof{Matt claims that 3.2.10, the above Lemma, is the beating heart of the paper.  Look how similar it looks to the formal group law quotient formula!  That's why an expanded formula must be included in the previous days, not just Neil's geometric scribblings}

\todo[color=red,inline]{Matt in and before Theorem 3.3.2 describes the ring $D_k$ as the \emph{image} of the localization map $E_n(B\Lambda_k) \to S^{-1} E_n(B\Lambda_k)$ rather than as the whole target.  Why??  He cites HKR for this, but the citation is meaningless because the theorem numbering scheme is so old.  Ah, comparing with Lemma 3.3.3 yields a clue: $D_k$ has a universal property as it sits under $E_n$, rather than under $E_n(B\Lambda_k)$...}

Now, suppose that we pass down to the $k${\th} Drinfel'd ring, so that the $p^k$--torsion in the formal group is presented as a discrete group $\Lambda^*[p^k]$.  Pick such a subgroup $H \subseteq \Lambda^*[p^k]$ with $|H| = r$, and consider also the dual map $\pi: \Lambda[p^k] \to H^*$.  We define the character map associated to $H$ to be the composite \[\chi^H \co E_n(D_{H^*} X) \xrightarrow{\Delta^*} E_n(BH^*) \otimes_{E_n} E_n(X) \xrightarrow{\chi_\pi \otimes 1} D_k \otimes_{E_n} E_n(X) =: D_k(X).\]  This definition is set up so that \[\chi^H \left( e \left( \begin{array}{c} EH^* \times_u \C \\ \downarrow \\ BH^* \end{array} \right) \right).\]  In the presence of a coordinate $x$, this sews together to give a cohomology operation:
\begin{align*}
Q^H \co MU^{2*}(X) & \xrightarrow{P^{MU}_G} MU^{2r*}(D_{H^*} X) \\
& \xrightarrow{\Delta^*} MU^{2r*}(BH^* \times X) \\
& \xrightarrow{t_x} E_n(BH^* \times X) \\
& \xrightarrow{\simeq} E_n BH^* \otimes_{E_n} E_n X \\
& \xrightarrow{\chi^H \otimes 1} D_k X.
\end{align*}
It turns out that $Q^H$ is a ring homomorphism (cf.\ careful manipulation of HKR's Theorem C, which may not be worth it to write out, but it seems like the main manipulation is the last line of Proof of Theorem 3.3.8 on pg.\ 466), so each choice of $H$ (and $x$) determines a new coordinate on $D_k$.
\begin{theorem}
The effect of $Q^H$ on Euler classes is \[Q^H e_{MU} \L = f_H^x e_x \L \in D_k(X),\] and its effect on coefficients is \[Q^H_* F_{MU} = F_x / H.\]
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
We chase through results established so far:
\begin{align*}
Q^H(e_{MU} \L) & = (\chi^H \otimes 1) \circ t_x \circ \Delta^* \circ P^{MU}_G (e_{MU} \L) \\
& = (\chi^H \otimes 1) \circ t_x \left( \prod_{u \in H^** = H} e_{MU} \left( \begin{array}{c} EH^* \times_u \C \\ \downarrow \\ BH^* \end{array} \right) +_{MU} e_{MU} \L \right) \\
& = (\chi^H \otimes 1) \left( \prod_{u \in H} e_{E_n} \left( \begin{array}{c} EH^* \times_u \C \\ \downarrow \\ BH^* \end{array} \right) +_{F_x} e_{E_n} \L \right) \\
& = \prod_{u \in H} (\phi_{univ}(u) +_{F_x} e_{E_n} \L) = f_H^x(e_{E_n} \L).
\end{align*}
Then, ``since $D_k$ is a domain, $F_x/H$ is completely determined by the functional equation'' \[f_H^x(F_x(t_1, t_2)) = F_x/H(f_H^x(t_1, f_H^x(t_2))).\]  Take $t_1$ and $t_2$ to be the Euler classes of the two tautological bundles $\L_1$ and $\L_2$ over $\CP^\infty \times \CP^\infty$, so that
\begin{align*}
Q^H(e_{MU} \L_1 +_{MU} e_{MU} \L_2) & = Q^H\left(e_{MU} \left( \begin{array}{c} \L_1 \otimes \L_2 \\ \downarrow \\ \CP^\infty \times \CP^\infty \end{array} \right)\right) \\
& = f_H^x \left(e_{E_n} \left( \begin{array}{c} \L_1 \otimes \L_2 \\ \downarrow \\ \CP^\infty \times \CP^\infty \end{array} \right)\right) = f_H^x(t_1 +_{F_x} t_2).
\end{align*}
On the other hand, $Q^H$ is a ring homomorphism, so we can also split it over the sum first:
\begin{align*}
Q^H(e_{MU} \L_1 +_{MU} e_{MU} \L_2) & = Q^H(e_{MU} \L_1) +_{Q^H_* F^{MU}} Q^H(e_{MU} \L_2) \\
& = f_H^x(t_1) +_{Q^H_* F^{MU}} f_H^x(t_2),
\end{align*}
hence $f_H^x(t_1) +_{Q^H_* F^{MU}} f_H^x(t_2) = f_H^x(t_1 +_{F_x} t_2)$ and $Q^H_* F^{MU} = F_x / H$.
\end{proof}

Finally, we would like to produce a factorization \[MU \xrightarrow{\Psi^H} E_n \to D_k\] of the long natural transformation $Q^H$.  Since $E_n$ was built by Landweber flatness, it suffices to do this on coefficient rings, i.e., when applying the functors in the diagram to the one-point space.  On a point, our calculations above show that $\Psi^H$ exists exactly when $\alpha^H_* F_x = F_x / H$.  We did this algebraic calculation earlier: given any coordinate, there is a unique coordinate $P$ that is $\star$--isomorphic to it and through which the operations $Q^H$ factor to give ring operations $\Psi^H$ for all subgroups $H \subseteq \Lambda_k^* = F_P(D_k)[p^k]$.  This solves the problem of giving the operations the right \emph{source}.

\todo[inline]{Leave a remark in here about this: McClure in BMMS works along similar lines to show that the Quillen idempotent is not $H_\infty$, but he doesn't get any positive results (and, in particular, he can't complete his analysis as we do because he doesn't have access to the $BP$--homology of finite groups and to HKR character theory).  One wonders whether the stuff here does say something about $BP$ as the height tends toward $\infty$.  So far as I know, no one has written much about this.  Surely it remains a bee in Matt's bonnet.}

Now we focus on giving the operations the right \emph{target}.  This is considerably easier.  The group $\Aut(\Lambda_k^*)$ acts on the set of subgroups of $\Lambda_k^*$, and we define a ring $Op^k$ by the fixed points of $\Aut(\Lambda_k^*)$ acting on the polynomial ring $E_n[\text{subgroups of $\Lambda_k^*$}]$.  Note that $Op^k \subseteq Op^{k+1}$, and define $Op = \colim_k Op^k$, which consists of elements $\rho = \sum_{i \in I} a_i \prod_{H \in \alpha_i} H$, $I$ a finite set, $a_i \in E_n$, and $\alpha_i$ are certain $\Aut(\Lambda_k^*)$--stable lists of subgroups of $\Lambda_k^*$, $k \gg 0$, with possible repetitions.  For such a $\rho$, we define the associated operations
\begin{align*}
Q^\rho \co MU^{2*}(X) & \xrightarrow{\sum_{i \in I} a_i \prod_{H \in \alpha_i} Q^H} D_k(X), \\
\Psi^\rho \co E_n(X) & \xrightarrow{\sum_{i \in I} a_i \prod_{H \in \alpha_i} \Psi^H} D_k(X).
\end{align*}
The theorem is that these actually land in $E_n(X)$, as they definitely land in $D_k^{\Aut(\Lambda_k^*)} \otimes_{E_n} E_n(X)$, and Galois descent for level structures says that left--hand factor is just $E_n$.

\todo{Matt runs the example of the subgroups $\G_m[p^j]$ in $p$--adic $K$--theory and he compares it with some Hopf ring analysis of $E_n \OS{E_n}{*}$ due to Wilson}





\section{The moduli of subgroup divisors}

Following... the original? Following Nat?

Continuing on from the above, if we expected $E_n$ to be $E_\infty$ (or even $H_\infty$) so that it had power operations, then we would want to understand $E_n B\Sigma_{p^j}$ and match that with the operations we see.

---

There are union maps \[B\Sigma_j \times B\Sigma_k \to B\Sigma_{j+k},\] stable transfer maps \[B\Sigma_{j+k} \to B\Sigma_j \times B\Sigma_k,\] and diagonal maps \[B\Sigma_j \to B\Sigma_j \times B\Sigma_j.\]  These induce a coproduct $\psi$ as well as products $\times$ and $\bullet$ on $E^0 \P \S^0$, where $\P\S^0 = \coprod_{j=0}^\infty B\Sigma_j$ is the free $E_\infty$--ring on $\S^0$.  This is a Hopf ring, and under $\times$ alone it is a formal power series ring.  The $\times$--indecomposables (which, I guess, are analogues of considering additive unstable cooperations) are \[Q^\times E^0 \P\S^0 = \prod_{k \ge 0} \left( E^0 B\Sigma_{p^k} / \operatorname{tr} E^0 B\Sigma_{p^{k-1}}^p \right),\] where the $k${\th} factor in the product is naturally isomorphic to $\sheaf{O}_{\Sub_{p^k}(\G)}$.  The primitives are also accessible as the kernel of the dual restriction map.

Theorem 3.2 shows that $E^0 B\Sigma_k$ is free over $E^0$, Noetherian, and of rank controlled by generalized binomial coefficients.  Prop 3.4 is the only place where work gets done, and it's all in terms of $K$--theory and HKR characters.

There's actually an extra coproduct, coming from applying $D$ to the fold map $S^0 \vee S^0 \to S^0$.

The main content of Prop 5.1 (due to Kashiwabara) is that $K_0 \P \S^0$ injects into $K_0 \OS{BP}{0}$.  Grading $K_0 \P \S^0$ using the $k$--index in $B\Sigma_k$, you can see that it's of graded finite type, so we need only know it has no nilpotent elements to see that $K_0 \P \S^0$ is $\ast$--polynomial.  This follows from our computation that $K_0 \OS{BP}{0}$ is a tensor of power series and Laurent series rings.  Corollary 5.2 is about $K_0 Q S^0$, which is the group completion of $K_0 \P \S^0$, so it's the tensor of $K_0 \P \S^0$ with a graded field.

Prop 5.6, using a double bar spectral sequence method, shows that $K^0 Q S^2$ is a formal power series algebra.  Tracking the spectral sequences through, you'll find that $Q^\times K^0 Q S^0$ agrees with $P K^0 Q S^2$.  (You'll also notice that $K^0 Q S^2$ only has one product on it, cf.\ Remark 5.4.)

Snaith's theorem says $\Sigma^\infty QX = \Sigma^\infty \P X$ for connected spaces $X$.  You can also see (just after Theorem 6.2) the nice equivalences \[\P_k S^2 \simeq B\Sigma_k^{V_k} \simeq \P_k(S^0)^{V_k},\] where superscript denotes Thom complex.  So, for a complex-orientable cohomology theory, you can learn about $\P_k S^0$ from $\P_k S^2$.  In particular, we finally learn that $E^0 \P S^0$ is a formal power series $\times$--algebra (once checking that the Thom isomorphism is a ring map).  (We already knew the homological version of this claim.)

Section 8 has a nice discussion about indecomposables and primitives, to help move back and forth between homology and cohomology.  It probably helps most with the dimension count argument below that we aren't going to get into.

Start again with $D_{p^k} S^2 \simeq B\Sigma_{p^k}^{V_{p^k}}$.  We can associate to this a divisor $\D(V_{p^k})$ on $(B\Sigma_{p^k})_E$, which we know little about, but it is classified by a map to $\Div_{p^k} \CP^\infty_E$.  This receives a closed inclusion from $\Sub_{p^k} \CP^\infty_E$, so their pullback $Z_k$ is the largest subscheme of $(B\Sigma_{p^k})_E$ over which $\D(V_{p^k})$ is a subgroup divisor.
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
H_k \arrow{rr} \arrow{dd} & & \D(V_{p^k}) \\
& Z_k \arrow{rr} \arrow{rd} & & \Sub_{p^k} \CP^\infty_E \arrow{rd} \\
\Spf E^0 B\Sigma_{p^k} / \mathrm{tr} \arrow{rr} \arrow[densely dotted]{ru} & & (B\Sigma_{p^k})_E \arrow{rr} \arrow[crossing over,leftarrow]{uu} & & \Div_{p^k} \CP^\infty_E
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
We will show the existence of the dashed map, implying that the restricted divisor $H_k$ is a subgroup divisor on $Y_k = \Spf E^0 B\Sigma_{p^k} / \mathrm{tr}$.

(Prop 9.1:) This proof falls into two parts: first we construct a family of maps to $(B\Sigma_{p^k})_E$ on whose image $\D(V_{p^k})$ restricts to a subgroup divisor, and then we show that the union of their images is exactly $Y_k$.  Let $A$ be an abelian $p$--subgroup of $\Sigma_{p^k}$ that acts transitively on $\{1, \ldots, p^k\}$ (i.e., it is not boosted from some transfer).  The restriction of $V_{p^k}$ to $A$ is the regular representation, which splits as a sum of characters $V_{p^k}|_A = \bigoplus_{\L \in A^*} \L$.  Identifying $BA_E = \InternalHom{FormalGroups}(A^*, \CP^\infty_E)$, $\D(V_{p^k})$ restricts all the way to $\sum_{\L \in A^*} [\phi(\L)]$, with $\phi: A^* \to $``$\Gamma(\operatorname{Hom}(A^*, \G), \G)$''.  In Finite Subgroups of Formal Groups (see Props 22 and 32), we learned that the restriction of $\D(V_{p^k})$ further to $\Level(A^*, \CP^\infty_E)$ is a subgroup divisor.  So, our collection of maps are those of the form \[\Level(A^*, \CP^\infty_E) \to \InternalHom{FormalGroups}(A^*, \CP^\infty_E) = BA_E \to (B\Sigma_{p^k})_E.\]  Here, finally, is where we have to do some real work involving Chern classes and commutative algebra, so I'm inclined to skip it in the lectures.  Finally, you do a dimension count to see that $Z_k$ and $\Spf E^0 B\Sigma_{p^k} / \mathrm{tr}$ have the same dimension (which requires checking enough commutative algebra to see that ``dimension'' even makes sense), and so you show the map is injective and you're done.


-----

Here's Neil's proof of the joint images claim.  It seems like a clear enough use of character theory that we should include it, if we can make character theory itself clear.

Recall from [18, Theorem 23] that $\Level(A^*,\G)$ is a smooth scheme, and thus that $D(A) = \sheaf O_{\Level(A^*,\G)}$ is an integral domain. Using [18, Proposition 26], we see that when $\L \in A^*$ is nontrivial, we have $\phi(\L) \ne 0$ as sections of $\G$ over $\Level(A^*, \G)$, and thus $e(\L) = x(\phi(\L)) \ne 0$ in $D(A)$. It follows that that $c_{p^k} = \prod_{\L \ne 1} e(\L)$ is not a zero-divisor in $D(A)$. On the other hand, if $A'$ is an Abelian $p$-subgroup of $\Sigma_{p^k}$ which does not act transitively on $\{1, \ldots, p^k\}$, then the restriction of $V_{p^k} − 1$ to $A'$ has a trivial summand, and thus $c_{p^k}$ maps to zero in $D(A')$. Next, we recall the version of generalised character theory described in [8, Appendix A].
\[p^{-1} E^0 BG = \left(\prod_A p^{-1} D(A)\right)^G\]
where $A$ runs over all Abelian $p$-subgroups of $G$. As $\overline R_k = E^0(B\Sigma_{p^k} )/ ann(c_{p^k} )$ and everything in sight is torsion-free, we see that $p^{−1} \overline R_k$ is the quotient of $p^{−1}E^0B\Sigma_{p^k}$ by the annihilator of the image of $c_{p^k}$ . Using our analysis of the images of $c_{p^k}$ in the rings $D(A)$, we conclude that
\[p^{-1} \overline R_k = \left(\prod_A p^{−1}D(A)\right)^{\Sigma_{p^k}},\]
where the product is now over all transitive Abelian $p$-subgroups. This implies that for such $A$, the map $E^0B\Sigma_{p^k} \to D(A)$ factors through $\overline R_k$, and that the resulting maps $\overline R_k \to D(A)$ are jointly injective. This means that $Y_k = \Spf \overline R_k$ is the union of the images of the corresponding schemes $\Level(A^*,\G)$, as required.








\section{Interaction with $\Theta$--structures}

The Ando--Hopkins--Strickland result that the $\sigma$--orientation is an $H_\infty$--map

The main classical point is that an $MU\<0\>$--orientation is $H_\infty$ when the following diagram commutes for every choice of $A$:
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
(BA^* \times \CP^\infty)^{V_{reg} \otimes \L} \arrow{r} & D_n MU\<0\> \arrow{d} \arrow{r} & D_n E \arrow{d} \\
& MU\<0\> \arrow{r} & E
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
(This is equivalent to the condition given in the section on Matt's thesis.  In fact, maybe I should try writing this so that Matt's thesis uses the same language?)  If you write out what this means, you'll see that a given coordinate on $E$ pulls back to give two elements in the $E$--cohomology of that Thom spectrum (or: sections of the Thom sheaf), and the orientation is $H_\infty$ when they coincide.

Similarly, an $MU\<6\>$--orientation corresponds to a section of the sheaf of cubical structures on a certain Thom sheaf.  Using the $H_\infty$ structures on $MU\<6\>$ and on $E$ give two sections of the pulled back sheaf of cubical structures, and the $H_\infty$ condition is that they agree for all choices of group $A$.




\todo{Section 12.4 compares doing $H_\infty$ descent with doing $E_\infty$ descent and shows that they're the same (in the case of interest?).}




\subsection*{Other stuff that goes in this chapter}

Dyer--Lashof operations, the Steenrod operations, and isogenies of the formal additive group \citeme{See Neil's \textit{Steenrod algebra} note, maybe? Talk to Mike?}

Another augmentation to the notion of a context: working not just with $E_* X$ but with $E_*(X \times BG)$ for finite $G$.

Charles's \textit{The congruence criterion} paper codifies the Hecke algebra picture Neil is talking about, and in particular it talks about sheaves over the pile of isogenies.

If we're going to talk about that Hecke algebra, then maybe we can also talk about the period map, since one of the main points of it is that it's equivariant for that action.

Section 3.7 of Matt's thesis also seems to deal with the context question: he gives a character-theoretic description of the total power operation, which ties the behavior of the total power operation to a formula of type ``decomposition into subgroups''.  Worth reading.

\todo{This is Nat's claim. Check back with him about how this is visible.}The rational story: start with a sheaf on the isogenies pile.  Tensor everything with $\Q$.  That turns this thing into a rational algebra under the Drinfel'd ring together with an equivariant action of $\GL_n \Q_p$.

Matt's Section 4 talks about the $E_\infty$ structure on $E_n$ and compatibility with his power operations.  It's not clear how this doesn't immediately follow from the stuff he proves in Section 3, but I think I'm just running out of stream in reading this thesis.  One of the neat features of this later section is that it relies on calculations in $E_n D_\pi \OS{MU}{2*}$, which is an interesting way to mix operations coming from instability and from an $H_\infty$--structure.  This is yet another clue about what the relevant picture of a context should look like.  He often cites VIII.7 of BMMS.
